    return search _ from ( start node ) [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` search _ from ` function is not defined inside the ` depth _ first _ search ` function , so it is not accessible from outside the function . 
 2 . The ` search _ from ` function is not returning anything , so the ` depth _ first _ search ` function will always return ` None `.

 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The ` search _ from ` function is now defined inside the ` depth _ first _ search ` function , so it is accessible from outside the function . 
 2 . The ` search _ from ` function now returns a value , so the ` depth _ first _ search ` function will return a value instead of ` None `.

 1 . The ` search _ from ` function is not properly defined . The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` if ` statement , and the ` any ` function should be used to return the result of the recursive call .
