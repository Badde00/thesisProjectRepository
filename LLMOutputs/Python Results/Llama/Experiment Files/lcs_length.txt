    return max ( dp . values ()) if d p else  0 [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` Counter ` class is not defined in the global scope , it needs to be imported from the ` collections ` module . 
 2 . The ` dp ` variable is not initialized , it needs to be set to an empty ` Counter ` object . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 from collections import C ounter 
 
 def l cs _ length ( s , t ): 
    d p = C ounter () 
 
    for i in range ( len ( s )): 
        for j in range ( len ( t )):

    return max ( dp . values ()) if d p else  0 [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function is not defined correctly . It should be defined as ` def l cs _ length ( s , t ): ` instead of ` def l cs _ length ( s , t ): ` 
 2 . The import statement is not correct . It should be ` from collections import C ounter ` instead of ` from collections import C ounter ` 
 3 . The variable ` dp ` is not defined . It should be defined as ` dp = C ounter ()` instead of ` dp = C ounter ()` 
 4 . The for loop is not correct . It should be ` for i in range ( len ( s )): for j in range ( len ( t )): if s [ i ] == t [ j ]: d p [ i , j ] = d p [ i -  1 , j ] +  1 ` instead of ` for i in range ( len ( s )): for j in range ( len ( t )): if s [ i ] == t [ j ]: d p [ i , j ] = d p [ i -  1 , j ] +  1 ` 
 5 . The return statement is not correct . It should be ` return max ( dp . values ()) if d p else  0 ` instead of ` return max ( dp . values ()) if d p else  0 ` 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def l cs _ length ( s , t ): 
    from collections import C ounter 
 
    d p = C ounter () 
 
    for i in range ( len ( s )): 
        for j in range ( len ( t )):
