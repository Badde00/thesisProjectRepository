    return - 1 [ / INST ]  There are no errors in the code . It appears to be a correct implementation of the binary search algorithm for finding the first occurrence of a value in a sorted array . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code with some minor improvements : 
 ``` 
 def find _ first _ in _ sorted ( arr , x ): 
    lo =  0 
    hi = len ( arr ) -  1 
 
    while lo <= hi : 
        mid = ( lo + hi ) //  2 
 
        if x == arr [ mid ] and ( mid ==  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ] ): 
            return mid 
 
        elif x <= arr [ mid ]: 
            hi = mid -  1 
 
        else : 
            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 
 ``` 
 The corrected version has the following improvements : 
 
 * The ` hi ` variable is initialized to ` len ( arr ) -  1 ` instead of ` len ( arr )`. This is because the ` mid ` variable is used to index the array , and the ` mid ` variable is calculated using the ` lo ` and ` hi ` variables . By initial izing ` hi ` to ` len ( arr ) -  1 `, we ensure that the ` mid ` variable is always within the bounds of the array . 
 * The ` return - 1 ` statement is moved to the end of the function , after the loop has completed . This is because the function should return `- 1 ` only if the value is not found in the array . If the value is found , the function should return the index of the first occurrence . 
 
 Over all , the corrected version of the code is function ally equivalent to the original code , but it is more efficient and easier to read .

            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 [ / INST ]  There are no errors in the code . However , there is a potential issue with the logic . The code assumes that the input array is sorted in asc ending order , but it does not handle the case where the input array is not sorted . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code that handles the case where the input array is not sorted : 
 ``` 
 def find _ first _ in _ sorted ( arr , x ): 
    lo =  0 
    hi = len ( arr ) 
 
    while lo < hi : 
        mid = ( lo + hi ) //  2 
 
        if x == arr [ mid ] and ( mid ==  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ] ): 
            return mid 
 
        elif x <= arr [ mid ]: 
            hi = mid 
 
        else : 
            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 
 ``` 
 In the corrected version , the ` while ` loop condition is changed to ` lo < hi ` instead of ` lo <= hi `. This ens ures that the loop will continue to iterate until the end of the array is reached , even if the input array is not sorted . 
 
 Add itionally , the ` if ` statement that checks if the element at the mid point is equal to the target value is modified to also check if the element at the mid point is not equal to the element at the previous index . This ens ures that the function will return the first occurrence of the target value , even if the input array is not sorted .

        else : 
            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 
 ``` 
 In the corrected version , the ` while ` loop condition is changed from ` lo <= hi ` to ` lo < hi `. This ens ures that the loop will continue until ` lo ` is strictly less than ` hi `, which means that the loop will run at least once even if the input array is not sorted . 
 
 Add itionally , the ` if ` statement that checks if the element at ` mid ` is the first occurrence of ` x ` is modified to check if ` mid ` is equal to  0 or if ` x ` is not equal to the element at ` mid -  1 `. This ens ures that the function will return the correct index even if the input array is not sorted . 
 
 With these changes , the function should work correctly for both sorted and un sorted input arrays .
