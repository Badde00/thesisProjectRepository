    while heap : 
        yield heap q . he app op ( he ap ) [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` he ap q . he ap ify ` function takes a list as an argument , but ` he ap ` is a tuple . To fix this , change ` he ap = arr [: k ]` to ` he ap = list ( arr [: k ]) `. 
 2 . The ` he ap q . he app ush pop ` function takes two arguments : the heap and the element to be pushed . However , the code is passing only one argument , which is the element to be pushed . To fix this , change ` y ield heap q . he app ush pop ( he ap , x )` to ` y ield heap q . he app ush pop ( he ap , ( x , )) `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def k he aps ort ( arr , k ): 
    import heap q 
 
    heap = list ( arr [: k ]) 
    heap q . he ap ify ( he ap )

 1 . The ` he ap q . he app ush pop ` function takes two arguments , the heap and the element to be pushed , in that order . However , the code is passing only one argument , ` he ap `, which is a list . To fix this , the function call should be ` he ap q . he app ush pop ( he ap , x )`. 
 2 . The ` he ap q . he app op ` function takes one argument , the heap , and returns the smallest element in the heap . However , the code is calling ` he ap q . he app op ` with no arguments , which is not correct . To fix this , the function call should be ` he ap q . he app op ( he ap )`. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def k he aps ort ( arr , k ): 
    import heap q 
 
    heap = arr [: k ]

 2 . The ` while ` loop is not necessary , as the ` he ap q . he app op ` function will automatically remove the elements from the heap as they are po pped . To fix this , the ` while ` loop can be removed .
