        node . success or = prev node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop . Here is the corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def reverse _ link ed _ list ( node ): 
    prev node = None 
    while node : 
        next node = node . success or 
        node . success or = prev node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop , so that it is executed only when the loop is finished . Otherwise , the function will return ` prev node ` as soon as the first node is processed , which is not what we want .

 def reverse _ link ed _ list ( node ): 
    prev node = None 
    while node : 
        next node = node . success or 
        node . success or = prev node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the provided code : 
 
 1 . The function name is not properly capital ized . It should be " Re verse Link ed List " instead of " reverse _ link ed _ list ". 
 2 . The function takes a single argument " node ", but it is not defined . It should be defined as a parameter of the function . 
 3 . The function does not return anything . It should return the revers ed linked list . 
 4 . The while loop condition is not properly defined . It should be " while node is not None " instead of " while node ". 
 5 . The next node variable is not defined . It should be defined as " next node = node . success or ". 
 6 . The node . success or assignment is not properly defined . It should be " node . success or = prev node " instead of " node = next node ". 
 7 . The prev node variable is not defined . It should be defined as " prev node = node . success or ". 
 8 . The function does not handle the case where the linked list is empty . It should return None in that case . 
 
 Here is the corrected version of the code : 
 
 def Re verse Link ed List ( node ): 
    prev node = None 
    while node is not None : 
        next node = node . success or 
        node . success or = prev node 
        prev node = node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node 
 
 This corrected version of the code should work correctly and return the revers ed linked list .
