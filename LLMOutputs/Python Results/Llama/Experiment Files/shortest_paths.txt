    return weight _ by _ node [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` weight _ by _ node ` dictionary is not initialized correctly . It should be initialized with ` weight _ by _ node = { v : float (' inf ') for v in weight _ by _ edge } `. 
 2 . The ` for ` loop in the ` short est _ paths ` function is not correct . It should be ` for i in range ( len ( weight _ by _ node )) :` instead of ` for i in range ( len ( weight _ by _ node ) -  1 ): `. 
 3 . The ` weight _ by _ edge ` dictionary is not used correctly in the ` short est _ paths ` function . It should be ` weight _ by _ edge [( u , v )] = min ( weight _ by _ node [ u ] + weight , weight _ by _ node [ v ]) ` instead of ` weight _ by _ edge [ u , v ] = min ( weight _ by _ node [ u ] + weight , weight _ by _ node [ v ]) `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def short est _ paths ( source , weight _ by _ edge ): 
    weight _ by _ node = { v : float (' inf ') for v in weight _ by _ edge } 
    weight _ by _ node [ source ] =  0

    return weight _ by _ node [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is ` short est _ paths `, but the function is actually returning a dictionary of short est paths . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments : ` source ` and ` weight _ by _ edge `, but the function body only uses ` weight _ by _ edge `. 
 3 . The variable ` weight _ by _ node ` is not defined . 
 4 . The ` for ` loop in the function body is not properly ind ented . 
 5 . The ` return ` statement is not properly ind ented . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def short est _ paths ( source , weight _ by _ edge ): 
    weight _ by _ node = { 
        v : float (' inf ') for u , v in weight _ by _ edge 
    }

                weight _ by _ node [ v ] 
            ) 
 
    return weight _ by _ edge 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The function name is now ` short est _ paths ` to match the purpose of the function . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments : ` source ` and ` weight _ by _ edge `, which are used in the function body . 
 3 . The variable ` weight _ by _ node ` is now defined and initialized with the same keys as ` weight _ by _ edge `. 
 4 . The ` for ` loop is properly ind ented and the ` return ` statement is also properly ind ented . 
 5 . The function now returns the dictionary ` weight _ by _ edge ` which contains the short est paths .
