    else : 
        return [ [] ] [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The line ` first , * rest = arr ` is not valid Python syntax . In Python  3 , you can use the ` *` operator to un pack a list into multiple variables , but you cannot use it to un pack a tuple . In this case , you should use the ` *` operator to un pack the tuple into multiple variables , like this : ` first , * rest = arr `. 
 2 . The line ` rest _ subset s = powers et ( rest )` is not valid Python syntax . In Python , you cannot use a function name as a variable name . In this case , you should use a different variable name , like this : ` rest _ subset s = powers et ( rest )`. 
 3 . The line ` return [[ first ] + subset for subset in rest _ subset s ]` is not valid Python syntax . In Python , you cannot use a list compreh ension to create a list of lists . In this case , you should use a for loop to create the list of lists , like this : ` result = [] ` ` for subset in rest _ subset s :` ` result . append ([ first ] + subset )` ` return result `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def powers et ( arr ): 
    if arr : 
        first , * rest = arr 
        rest _ subset s = powers et ( rest ) 
        result = []
