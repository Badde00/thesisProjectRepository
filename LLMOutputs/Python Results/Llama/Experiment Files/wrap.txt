 def wrap ( text , cols ): 
    lines = [] 
    while len ( text ) > cols : 
        end = text . r find (' ',  0 , cols +  1 ) 
        if end == - 1 : 
            end = cols 
        line , text = text [: end ], text [ end :] 
        lines . append ( line ) 
 
    return lines [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` while ` loop condition should be ` len ( text ) >  0 `, not ` len ( text ) > cols `. This is because the ` while ` loop should continue as long as there is still text to wrap , not as long as the length of the text is greater than the number of columns . 
 2 . The ` lines . append ( line )` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop . This is because the ` append ` method should be called for each line that is generated , not just once at the end of the loop . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def wrap ( text , cols ): 
    lines = [] 
    while len ( text ) >  0 : 
        end = text . r find (' ',  0 , cols +  1 ) 
        if end == - 1 : 
            end = cols 
        line , text = text [: end ], text [ end :] 
        lines . append ( line ) 
 
    return lines

        lines . append ( line ) 
 
    return lines [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` while ` loop condition should be ` while len ( text ) >  0 `, not ` len ( text ) > cols `. This is because the ` r find ` method returns - 1 if the substring is not found , and the ` while ` loop should continue until the entire string has been processed . 
 2 . The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop , not outside of it . This is because the ` return ` statement is part of the ` while ` loop ' s body , and should be executed after each iteration . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def wrap ( text , cols ): 
    lines = [] 
    while len ( text ) >  0 : 
        end = text . r find (' ',  0 , cols +  1 )

        line , text = text [: end ], text [ end :] 
        lines . append ( line ) 
 
    return lines [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the provided code : 
 
 1 . The function name is ` wrap ` but the function is actually returning a list of lines . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments , ` text ` and ` cols `, but the function body only uses ` text `. 
 3 . The function uses a variable ` lines ` which is not defined . 
 4 . The function uses a variable ` end ` which is not defined . 
 5 . The function uses a variable ` line ` which is not defined . 
 6 . The function uses a variable ` text ` which is not defined . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def wrap ( text , cols ): 
    lines = [] 
    while len ( text ) > cols : 
        end = text . r find (' ',  0 , cols +  1 ) 
        if end == - 1 : 
            end = cols 
        line = text [: end ] 
        lines . append ( line ) 
        text = text [ end :] 
 
    return lines 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The function name is now ` wrap ` which is more descript ive of its purpose . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments , ` text ` and ` cols `, which are used in the function body . 
 3 . The variable ` lines ` is now defined and is used to store the list of lines . 
 4 . The variable ` end ` is now defined and is used to store the index of the last space character in the line . 
 5 . The variable ` line ` is now defined and is used to store the current line . 
 6 . The variable ` text ` is now defined and is used to store the remaining text . 
 
 The corrected code is more readable and easier to understand , and it fixes the errors in the original code .

    return lines [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` while ` loop condition is incorrect . It should be ` while len ( text ) >  0 `, not ` len ( text ) > cols `. 
 2 . The ` lines . append ( line )` statement should be ind ented to be inside the ` while ` loop . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ```

 1 . The ` while ` loop condition should be ` len ( text ) >  0 `, not ` len ( text ) > cols `. This is because the ` while ` loop is intended to iterate until the entire ` text ` string has been wrapped into ` cols ` columns . 
 2 . The ` lines . append ( line )` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop . This is because the ` line ` variable is defined within the ` while ` loop , and it should be app ended to the ` lines ` list after each iteration .
