 1 . The line ` ordered _ nodes = [ node for node in nodes if not node . in coming _ nodes ]` will not work as expected . The ` in coming _ nodes ` attribute is not defined in the ` node ` object , so this line will raise an error . 
 2 . The line ` if set ( ordered _ nodes ). iss up erset ( next node . out going _ nodes ) and next node not in ordered _ nodes :` will also raise an error . The ` out going _ nodes ` attribute is not defined in the ` next node ` object , so this line will also raise an error .

    ordered _ nodes = [] 
 
    for node in nodes : 
        if not node . in coming _ nodes :

 This code should work as expected , but it is not clear what the purpose of the function is or what the input ` nodes ` is supposed to represent .
