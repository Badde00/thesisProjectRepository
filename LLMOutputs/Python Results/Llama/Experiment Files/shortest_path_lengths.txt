 2 . The variable ` length _ by _ edge ` is defined and is a dictionary that maps each edge to its length . 
 3 . The variable ` n ` is defined and is the number of nodes in the graph . 
 4 . The ` for ` loop in the function ` short est _ path _ length s ` has been corrected to use the correct syntax . 
 5 . The ` min ` function is defined and is used to find the minimum of two values .
