 # Python  3 
 def possible _ change ( co ins , total ): 
    if total ==  0 : 
        return  1 
    if total <  0 : 
        return  0 
 
    first , * rest = co ins 
    return possible _ change ( co ins , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function ` possible _ change ` is defined to take two arguments , ` co ins ` and ` total `, but it is called with only one argument , ` total `. 
 2 . The function ` possible _ change ` is defined to return a value based on the value of ` total `, but it is not clear how the value of ` total ` is being updated . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 # Python  3 
 def possible _ change ( co ins , total ): 
    if total ==  0 : 
        return  1 
    if total <  0 : 
        return  0 
 
    first , * rest = co ins 
    return possible _ change ( co ins , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) 
 ``` 
 In this corrected version , the function ` possible _ change ` is called with two arguments , ` co ins ` and ` total `, and it returns a value based on the value of ` total `. The value of ` total ` is updated by subtract ing the first element of ` co ins ` from it .

    first , * rest = co ins 
    return possible _ change ( co ins , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function ` possible _ change ` is defined with two parameters , ` co ins ` and ` total `, but it is called with only one parameter , ` total `. This will result in a ` Type Error `. 
 2 . The line ` first , * rest = co ins ` is not correct . The ` *` operator is used to un pack a list into multiple variables , but ` co ins ` is not a list . This will result in a ` Type Error `. 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def possible _ change ( co ins , total ): 
    if total ==  0 : 
        return  1 
    if total <  0 : 
        return  0 
 
    first = co ins [ 0 ] 
    rest = co ins [ 1 :] 
    return possible _ change ( rest , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) 
 ``` 
 This corrected version of the code defines the function with two parameters , ` co ins ` and ` total `, and uses the ` first ` and ` rest ` variables to un pack the ` co ins ` list . It also uses the ` *` operator to un pack the ` rest ` list .

    first , * rest = co ins 
    return possible _ change ( co ins , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function is not defined correctly . The ` *` in the function definition is not necessary and should be removed . The corrected function definition should be : 
 ``` 
 def possible _ change ( co ins , total ): 
 ``` 
 2 . The function is not returning the correct value . The function should return the sum of the two recursive calls , not the result of the first call . The corrected function should be : 
 ``` 
 def possible _ change ( co ins , total ): 
    if total ==  0 : 
        return  1 
    if total <  0 : 
        return  0 
 
    first , rest = co ins 
    return possible _ change ( rest , total - first ) + possible _ change ( rest , total ) 
 ``` 
 The corrected code should return the correct value for the number of possible ways to make change for a given total using a set of co ins .

 1 . The function is not returning anything when the total is  0 . It should return  1 instead .

 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The ` first ` and ` rest ` variables are defined correctly in the corrected code . 
 2 . The function is returning the correct value in the corrected code . The function should return the number of ways to make the change , not the number of ways to make the change minus the number of ways to make the change .
