 def bit count ( n ): 
    count =  0 
    while n : 
        n ^ = n -  1 
        count +=  1 
    return count [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` while ` loop condition should be ` while n >  0 `, not ` while n `. 
 2 . The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def bit count ( n ): 
    count =  0 
    while n >  0 : 
        n ^ = n -  1 
        count +=  1 
    return count 
 ```

    while n :

        count +=  1 
    return count [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The line ` n ^ = n -  1 ` will not work as expected . 
 
 The correct code should be : 
 ``` 
 def bit count ( n ): 
    count =  0 
    while n : 
        n &= n -  1 
        count +=  1 
    return count 
 ``` 
 The error in the original code is that ` n ^ = n -  1 ` will not clear the least significant bit of ` n ` as expected . Instead , it will f lip the least significant bit to  0 and set all other bits to  1 . This will cause the loop to run in def initely . 
 
 The corrected code uses the bit wise AND operator `& =` to clear the least significant bit of ` n ` instead of the bit wise X OR operator ` ^ = `. This ens ures that the loop will terminate when ` n ` becomes  0 .

 The corrected code uses the bit wise AND operator `& =` to clear the least significant bit of ` n ` instead of the bit wise X OR operator ` ^ = `. This is because the bit wise AND operator will clear the least significant bit of ` n ` without affect ing the other bits . 
 
 The corrected code also includes a ` return ` statement at the end to return the value of ` count `.
