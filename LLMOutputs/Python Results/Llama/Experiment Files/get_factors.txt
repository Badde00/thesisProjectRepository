 def get _ fact ors ( n ): 
    if n ==  1 : 
        return [] 
 
    for i in range ( 2 , int ( n **  0 . 5 ) +  1 ): 
        if n % i ==  0 : 
            return [ i ] + get _ fact ors ( n // i ) 
 
    return [] [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function returns an empty list if ` n ` is equal to  1 , but it should return a list containing  1 instead . 
 2 . The function does not handle the case where ` n ` is a perfect square . In this case , the function should return a list containing the square root of ` n `. 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def get _ fact ors ( n ): 
    if n ==  1 : 
        return [ 1 ] 
 
    for i in range ( 2 , int ( n **  0 . 5 ) +  1 ): 
        if n % i ==  0 : 
            return [ i ] + get _ fact ors ( n // i ) 
 
    return [ int ( n **  0 . 5 )] 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The function now returns a list containing  1 if ` n ` is equal to  1 . 
 2 . The function now handles the case where ` n ` is a perfect square by returning a list containing the square root of ` n `.

 This code uses a list to store the factors of the input number , and it uses the ` extend ` method to add the factors of the recursive call to the list . The ` return ` statement is ind ented properly , and the code is more readable .

 This code should work as expected . It returns a list of factors of a given number . If the number is  1 , it returns an empty list . Otherwise , it checks if the number is divis ible by any number between  2 and the square root of the number , and if it is , it returns a list containing the divis or and the factors of the number divided by the divis or . If the number is not divis ible by any number between  2 and the square root of the number , it returns an empty list .

 This code should work as expected . It returns a list of factors of a given number , including the number itself . If the number is  1 , it returns an empty list . Otherwise , it returns a list of factors , including the number itself , by recurs ively calling the function with the number divided by the current factor .
