 1 . The function is not defined correctly . It should be defined as ` def next _ per mut ation ( perm ): ` 
 2 . The for loop is not ind ented correctly . It should be ind ented to the same level as the function definition . 
 3 . The if statement is not ind ented correctly . It should be ind ented to the same level as the for loop . 
 4 . The for loop is not using the correct range . It should be ` for i in range ( len ( perm ) -  2 , - 1 , - 1 ): ` 
 5 . The if statement is not checking the correct condition . It should be ` if perm [ i ] < perm [ i +  1 ]: ` 
 6 . The for loop is not using the correct variable . It should be ` for j in range ( len ( perm ) -  1 , i , - 1 ): ` 
 7 . The if statement is not checking the correct condition . It should be ` if perm [ j ] < perm [ i ]: ` 
 8 . The next _ perm variable is not defined correctly . It should be ` next _ perm = list ( perm )` 
 9 . The next _ perm variable is not being assigned correctly . It should be ` next _ perm [ i ], next _ perm [ j ] = perm [ j ], perm [ i ]` 
 1 0 . The next _ perm variable is not being revers ed correctly . It should be ` next _ perm [ i +  1 :] = revers ed ( next _ perm [ i +  1 : ]) `
