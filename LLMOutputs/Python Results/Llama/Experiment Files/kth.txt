 3 . The variables " below " and " above " are now defined as lists of elements in " arr " that are less than and greater than " p ivot ", respectively . 
 4 . The variables " num _ less " and " num _ less ore q " are now defined as the number of elements in " below " and " above ", respectively . 
 5 . The function now has a base case where if the length of the array is  1 , the function returns the only element in the array . 
 6 . The function now has a recursive case where if the value of " k " is less than the number of elements in " below ", the function calls itself with the " below " array and the updated value of " k ". If the value of " k " is greater than or equal to the number of elements in " above ", the function calls itself with the " above " array and the updated value of " k ". Otherwise , the function returns the " p ivot " element .
