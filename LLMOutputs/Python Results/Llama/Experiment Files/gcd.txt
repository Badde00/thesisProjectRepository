        return g cd ( a % b , b ) [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The function is not returning the correct value . 
 
 Here is the corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def g cd ( a , b ): 
    if b ==  0 : 
        return a 
    else : 
        return g cd ( b , a % b ) 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 The function was returning the wrong value because the recursive call was not using the correct arguments . The corrected version uses the correct arguments to ensure that the function is returning the correct value .

 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 The error in the original code was that the function was calling itself with the wrong arguments . The function should be calling itself with the arguments ` b ` and ` a % b `, not ` a ` and ` b `. This is because the function is recurs ively calling itself until the ` b ` argument is equal to  0 , and the ` a ` argument is the result of the recursive call .

 Ex plan ation : 
 The error in the original code was that the function was calling itself with the wrong arguments . The function should be called with ` g cd ( b , a % b )` instead of ` g cd ( a % b , b )`. This is because the function is recurs ively calling itself with the arguments ` a % b ` and ` b `, which is the correct way to calculate the greatest common divis or .
