 def quick sort ( arr ): 
    if not arr : 
        return [] 
 
    pivot = arr [ 0 ] 
    less er = quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x < pivot ]) 
    greater = quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x > pivot ]) 
    return less er + [ p ivot ] + greater [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function is not defined correctly . The correct definition should be : 
 
 def quick sort ( arr ): 
 
 2 . The function is not returning anything . The correct return statement should be : 
 
 return quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x < pivot ]) + [ p ivot ] + quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x > pivot ]) 
 
 3 . The function is not handling the case where the list is empty . The correct if statement should be : 
 
 if not arr : 
    return [] 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 
 def quick sort ( arr ): 
    if not arr : 
        return [] 
    pivot = arr [ 0 ] 
    less er = quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x < pivot ]) 
    greater = quick sort ([ x for x in arr [ 1 :] if x > pivot ]) 
    return less er + [ p ivot ] + greater 
 
 This code should now work correctly .
