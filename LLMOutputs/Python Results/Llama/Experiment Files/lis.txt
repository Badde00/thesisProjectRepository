 1 . The function ` lis ` is not defined properly . It should be defined as ` def l is ( arr ): ` instead of ` def l is ( arr ): `. 
 2 . The variable ` ends ` is not defined . It should be defined as ` ends = {} ` before the ` for ` loop . 
 3 . The variable ` long est ` is not defined . It should be defined as ` long est =  0 ` before the ` for ` loop . 
 4 . The ` for ` loop should be ind ented . 
 5 . The ` prefix _ length s ` list compreh ension is not properly defined . It should be defined as `[ j for j in range ( 1 , longest +  1 ) if arr [ ends [ j ]] < val ]` instead of `[ j for j in range ( 1 , longest +  1 ) if arr [ ends [ j ]] < val ]`. 
 6 . The ` length ` variable is not defined . It should be defined as ` length = max ( prefix _ length s ) if prefix _ length s else  0 ` instead of ` length = max ( prefix _ length s ) if prefix _ length s else  0 `. 
 7 . The ` if ` statement is not properly ind ented . It should be ind ented to the same level as the ` for ` loop . 
 8 . The ` return ` statement is not properly ind ented . It should be ind ented to the same level as the ` for ` loop .
