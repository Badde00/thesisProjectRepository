        i = num % b 
        num = num // b 
        result = result + alphabet [ i ] 
    return result [ / INST ]  There are a few errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is ` to _ base `, but the function is actually converting a number from a base  1 0 system to a base  3 6 system . 
 2 . The variable ` al phabet ` is defined as ` string . dig its + string . as cii _ upper case `, but it should be ` string . dig its + string . as cii _ lower case ` to include all lower case letters . 
 3 . The ` result ` variable is not initialized before it is used in the ` while ` loop . 
 4 . The ` return ` statement is missing a colon after the function name . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 import string 
 
 def to _ base ( num , b ): 
    result = '' 
    alphabet = string . dig its + string . as cii _ lower case 
    while num >  0 : 
        i = num % b 
        num = num // b 
        result = result + alphabet [ i ] 
    return result :

        num = num // b 
        result = result + alphabet [ i ] 
    return result [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is ` to _ base `, but the function is actually converting a number to a string . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments , ` num ` and ` b `, but the function body does not use these arguments . 
 3 . The function uses a variable ` al phabet ` which is not defined . 
 4 . The function uses a variable ` result ` which is not defined . 
 5 . The function uses a variable ` i ` which is not defined . 
 6 . The function uses a variable ` num ` which is not defined . 
 7 . The function uses a variable ` b ` which is not defined . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 import string 
 
 def to _ string ( num , b ): 
    result = '' 
    alphabet = string . dig its + string . as cii _ upper case 
    while num >  0 : 
        i = num % b 
        num = num // b 
        result = result + alphabet [ i ] 
    return result 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The function name is now ` to _ string ` to reflect the fact that it converts a number to a string . 
 2 . The function takes two arguments , ` num ` and ` b `, which are used in the function body . 
 3 . The variable ` al phabet ` is defined as a concaten ation of ` string . dig its ` and ` string . as cii _ upper case `. 
 4 . The variable ` result ` is defined as an empty string , and is used to store the converted string . 
 5 . The variable ` i ` is defined as the remainder of ` num ` divided by ` b `. 
 6 . The variable ` num ` is defined as the input number , and is used in the calculation of ` i `. 
 7 . The variable ` b ` is defined as the base , and is used in the calculation of ` i `. 
 
 Note : The corrected code is not complete , as it does not handle the case where ` num ` is  0 .
