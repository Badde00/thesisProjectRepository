    return False [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` return False ` statement is not ind ented properly . It should be ind ented to the same level as the ` while ` loop . 
 2 . The ` nodes seen ` set is not updated correctly . It should be updated with the ` node . success ors ` list , not the ` node ` itself . 
 
 Here is the corrected code :
