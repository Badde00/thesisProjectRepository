 2 . The ` insert _ or _ update ` function is not defined . It should be defined as ` def insert _ or _ update ( node _ he ap , dist _ node ): for i , t pl in enumerate ( node _ he ap ): a , b = t pl if b == node : node _ he ap [ i ] = dist _ node # he ap q retain s sorted property return None ` 
 3 . The ` short est _ path _ length ` function is not defined . It should be defined as ` def short est _ path _ length ( length _ by _ edge , start node , goal node ): un vis ited _ nodes = [] # F ib He ap containing ( node , distance ) pairs he app ush ( un vis ited _ nodes , ( 0 , start node )) visited _ nodes = set () while len ( un vis ited _ nodes ) >  0 : distance , node = he app op ( un vis ited _ nodes ) if node is goal node : return distance visited _ nodes . add ( node ) for next node in node . success ors : if next node in visited _ nodes : continue insert _ or _ update ( un vis ited _ nodes , ( min ( get ( un vis ited _ nodes , next node ) or float (' inf '), get ( un vis ited _ nodes , next node ) + length _ by _ edge [ node , next node ]), next node )) return float (' inf ')` 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 from heap q import * 
 
 def get ( node _ he ap , wanted _ node ): 
    return next ( dist for dist , node in node _ he ap if node == wanted _ node ) 
 
 def insert _ or _ update ( node _ he ap , dist _ node ): 
    dist , node = dist _ node 
    for i , t pl in enumerate ( node _ he ap ): 
        a , b = t pl 
        if b == node : 
            node _ he ap [ i ] = dist _ node # he ap q retain s sorted property 
            return None 
 
    he app ush ( node _ he ap , dist _ node ) 
    return None 
 
 def short est _ path _ length ( length _ by _ edge , start node , goal node ): 
    un vis ited _ nodes = [] # F ib He ap containing ( node , distance ) pairs 
    he app ush ( un vis ited _ nodes , ( 0 , start node )) 
    visited _ nodes = set () 
 
    while len ( un vis ited _ nodes ) >  0 : 
        distance , node = he app op ( un vis ited _ nodes ) 
        if node is goal node : 
            return distance 
 
        visited _ nodes . add ( node ) 
 
        for next node in node . success ors : 
            if next node in visited _ nodes : 
                continue 
 
            insert _ or _ update ( un vis ited _ nodes , 
                ( min ( 
                    get ( un vis ited _ nodes , next node ) or float (' inf '), 
                    get ( un vis ited _ nodes , next node ) + length _ by _ edge [ node , next node ] 
                ), 
                next node ) 
            ) 
 
    return float (' inf ') 
 ```
