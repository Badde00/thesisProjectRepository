        ) 
 
    return ret [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is not properly defined . It should be ` sub sequ ences ` instead of ` sub sequ ences ( a , b , k )`. 
 2 . The function takes three arguments , but the definition only spec ifies two . The third argument should be ` k `. 
 3 . The ` for ` loop should be ` for i in range ( a , b +  1 - k ): ` instead of ` for i in range ( a , b +  1 - k ): ` 
 4 . The ` ret . extend ` line should be ` ret . extend ([ i ] + rest for rest in subsequ ences ( i +  1 , b , k -  1 ))` instead of ` ret . extend ( 
            [ i ] + rest for rest in subsequ ences ( i +  1 , b , k -  1 ) 
        ) ` 
 5 . The ` return ` statement should be ` return ret ` instead of ` return ret [ `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def subsequ ences ( a , b , k ): 
    if k ==  0 : 
        return [] 
 
    ret = [] 
    for i in range ( a , b +  1 - k ):
