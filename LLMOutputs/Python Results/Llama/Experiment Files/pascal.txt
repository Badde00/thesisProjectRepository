    return rows [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is " pas cal " but the function is actually returning a list of rows , not a single row . 
 2 . The variable " rows " is a list of lists , but it is not being initialized . 
 3 . The variable " row " is being used as a list , but it is not being initialized . 
 4 . The variable " u ple ft " and " u pr ight " are being used as variables , but they are not being defined . 
 5 . The condition " c >  0 " is not necessary , as the value of " c " will always be greater than or equal to  0 . 
 6 . The condition " c < r " is not necessary , as the value of " c " will always be less than or equal to the value of " r ". 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code :

 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The function name is now " pas cal " to match the name of the function . 
 2 . The variable " rows " is now initialized to an empty list . 
 3 . The variable " r " is now initialized to  1 . 
 4 . The variable " c " is now initialized to  0 . 
 5 . The variable " u ple ft " is now initialized to the value of the upper left element of the current row , or  0 if the current row is the first row . 
 6 . The variable " u pr ight " is now initialized to the value of the upper right element of the current row , or  0 if the current row is the first row . 
 7 . The variable " row " is now initialized to an empty list . 
 
 The corrected code returns a list of rows , where each row is a list of integers representing the Pascal ' s triangle .
