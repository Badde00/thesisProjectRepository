 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The ` range ` function in the ` for ` loop should start from  0 , not  1 , because the ` items ` list is indexed from  0 . 
 2 . The ` mem o ` dictionary should be initialized with the capacity and items as keys , not just the capacity , because the ` mem o ` dictionary is used to store the maximum value for each item and capacity . 
 3 . The ` mem o ` dictionary should be updated with the correct values for each item , not just the value of the previous item , because the ` mem o ` dictionary is used to store the maximum value for each item and capacity . 
 4 . The ` mem o ` dictionary should be accessed with the correct keys , not just the length of the items and capacity , because the ` mem o ` dictionary is used to store the maximum value for each item and capacity .
