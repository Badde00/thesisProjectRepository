 def longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a , b ): 
    if not a or not b : 
        return '' 
 
    elif a [ 0 ] == b [ 0 ]: 
        return a [ 0 ] + longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a [ 1 : ], b )

        return max ( 
            longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a , b [ 1 : ]), 
            longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a [ 1 : ], b ), 
            key = len 
        ) [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function takes two arguments , ` a ` and ` b `, but the function body only uses ` a ` and ` b [ 1 :] `. This means that the function will only work correctly if the second argument is a list with at least one element . 
 2 . The function returns a string , but the ` max ` function is used to compare the lengths of the sub strings . This will not work correctly if the sub strings are not strings . 
 3 . The ` key ` argument of the ` max ` function is not used correctly . The ` key ` argument should be a function that takes a single argument and returns a value that can be compared . In this case , the ` len ` function is used , but it should be called with the argument ` a ` or ` b `, not ` a [ 1 : ]` or ` b [ 1 :] `. 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a , b ): 
    if not a or not b : 
        return '' 
 
    elif a [ 0 ] == b [ 0 ]: 
        return a [ 0 ] + longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a [ 1 : ], b [ 1 : ]) 
 
    else : 
        return max ( 
            longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a , b [ 1 : ]), 
            longest _ common _ sub sequence ( a [ 1 : ], b ), 
            key = len 
        ) 
 ``` 
 This corrected version of the code uses the ` len ` function to compare the lengths of the sub strings , and it uses the ` a ` and ` b ` arguments to the ` long est _ common _ sub sequence ` function instead of ` a [ 1 : ]` and ` b [ 1 :] `.

 1 . The base case is not handled correctly . The function should return an empty string if either ` a ` or ` b ` is an empty string . 
 2 . The ` max ` function is used to compare the length of the longest common sub sequence , but it is not clear which sub sequence is being compared .
