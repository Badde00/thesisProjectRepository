                yield y 
        else : 
            yield fl atten ( x ) [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The function name is " fl atten " but it is not returning anything . 
 2 . The function takes an argument " arr " but it is not being used anywhere in the function . 
 3 . The function is using a recursive call to itself , but it is not passing any arguments to the recursive call . 
 4 . The function is using a yield statement , but it is not returning anything . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 
 def fl atten ( arr ): 
    for x in arr : 
        if is instance ( x , list ): 
            for y in fl atten ( x ): 
                yield y 
        else : 
            yield x 
 
 This corrected version of the code fixes the errors and returns the fl atten ed list .
