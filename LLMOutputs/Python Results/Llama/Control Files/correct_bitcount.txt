 def bit count ( n ):

        count +=  1 
    return count [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The line ` n &= n -  1 ` will result in a negative number , which will cause an error when trying to increment the count . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def bit count ( n ): 
    count =  0 
    while n : 
        n &= n -  1 
        if n <  0 : 
            break 
        count +=  1 
    return count 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 The corrected code checks if ` n ` is negative after each iteration of the loop . If ` n ` is negative , it means that the loop has reached the end of the binary representation of ` n `, and the count can be returned . If ` n ` is not negative , the loop continues until ` n ` is  0 , at which point the count is returned .

        count +=  1 
    return count [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The line ` n &= n -  1 ` will not work as expected . 
 
 The correct version of the code should be : 
 ``` 
 def bit count ( n ): 
    count =  0 
    while n : 
        n &= n -  1 
        count +=  1 
    return count 
 ``` 
 The error in the original code is that the line ` n &= n -  1 ` is not doing what it is intended to do . The `& ` operator is used for bit wise AND , but in this case , it is not doing what is expected . 
 
 The corrected version of the code uses the ` n &= n -  1 ` line to clear the least significant bit of ` n ` that is set to  1 . This is done by subtract ing  1 from ` n ` and then using the `& ` operator to clear the least significant bit that is set to  1 . 
 
 The corrected version of the code also includes a ` return ` statement at the end , which is necessary to return the value of ` count ` to the caller .

 The corrected version of the code uses the `- ` operator to subtract  1 from ` n `, which is the correct way to clear the least significant bit of ` n `. The `& ` operator is then used to perform a bit wise AND operation with ` n ` and the result of the sub tra ction , which is the correct way to clear the least significant bit of ` n `.
