 def reverse _ link ed _ list ( node ): 
    prev node = None 
    while node : 
        next node = node . success or 
        node . success or = prev node 
        prev node = node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the provided code : 
 
 1 . The function is named ` reverse _ link ed _ list `, but it does not actually reverse the linked list . It only assign s the ` success or ` attribute of each node to the ` prev node ` variable . 
 2 . The function does not return anything , even though it is declared to return a ` Node ` object . 
 3 . The function does not handle the case where the input ` node ` is ` None `. 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 def reverse _ link ed _ list ( node ): 
    prev node = None 
    while node : 
        next node = node . success or 
        node . success or = prev node 
        prev node = node 
        node = next node 
    return prev node 
 ``` 
 This corrected version of the code revers es the linked list by assigning the ` success or ` attribute of each node to the ` prev node ` variable , and then returning the last node in the revers ed list . It also handles the case where the input ` node ` is ` None `.

 Here is the corrected version of the code : 
 ```

    prev node = None 
    while node :

    return prev node 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 The corrected code returns the head of the revers ed linked list by returning the ` prev node ` variable , which is the last node of the revers ed list .
