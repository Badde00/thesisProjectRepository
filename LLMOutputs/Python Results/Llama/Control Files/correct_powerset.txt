 3 . The variable " first " is not defined . It should be " first = arr [ 0 ]" instead of " first , * rest = arr ". 
 4 . The variable " rest " is not defined . It should be " rest = arr [ 1 : ]" instead of " rest _ subset s = powers et ( rest ) ". 
 5 . The variable " rest _ subset s " is not defined . It should be " rest _ subset s = powers et ( rest )" instead of " rest _ subset s + [[ first ] + subset for subset in rest _ subset s ] ". 
 6 . The variable " subset " is not defined . It should be " subset = rest _ subset s " instead of " subset in rest _ subset s ". 
 7 . The variable " [] " is not defined . It should be " [] " instead of "[ / ".
