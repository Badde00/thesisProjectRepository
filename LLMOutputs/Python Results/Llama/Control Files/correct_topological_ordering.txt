 This code first creates an empty list ` ordered _ nodes `. Then it iter ates over the ` nodes ` list and adds each node that has no incoming edges to the ` ordered _ nodes ` list . 
 
 Next , it iter ates over the ` ordered _ nodes ` list and for each node , it iter ates over its out going edges and adds the next node to the ` ordered _ nodes ` list if it has no incoming edges and it is not already in the ` ordered _ nodes ` list . 
 
 Fin ally , it returns the ` ordered _ nodes ` list .

 2 . The line ` if set ( ordered _ nodes ). iss up erset ( next node . in coming _ nodes ) and next node not in ordered _ nodes :` will also raise an ` Attribute Error `, because the ` in coming _ nodes ` attribute is not defined for the ` next node ` object .

 This code uses a list compreh ension to create a new list of nodes that have no incoming edges , and then iter ates over the list of nodes to find the next node that has no incoming edges and append it to the ` ordered _ nodes ` list . The ` iss up erset ` method is used to check if the set of incoming edges for the next node is a subset of the set of incoming edges for the current node .
