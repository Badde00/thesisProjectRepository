        else : 
            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The condition ` mid ==  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ]` should be ` mid >  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ]`. The reason for this is that ` mid ` is an index into the array , and the first element of the array has an index of  0 . Therefore , the condition ` mid ==  0 ` will never be true , and the element at index  0 will always be considered to be the first element in the array . 
 2 . The return value of the function should be ` mid -  1 ` instead of ` mid `. The reason for this is that the function is supposed to return the index of the first element in the array that is equal to ` x `, and the index of the first element is  0 . Therefore , the return value should be the index of the last element that is equal to ` x `, which is ` mid -  1 `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def find _ first _ in _ sorted ( arr , x ): 
    lo =  0 
    hi = len ( arr ) 
 
    while lo < hi : 
        mid = ( lo + hi ) //  2 
 
        if x == arr [ mid ] and ( mid >  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ] ): 
            return mid -  1 
 
        elif x <= arr [ mid ]: 
            hi = mid

    return - 1 [ / INST ]  There are no errors in the code . It appears to be a correct implementation of the binary search algorithm for finding the first occurrence of a value in a sorted array . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code with some minor improvements : 
 ``` 
 def find _ first _ in _ sorted ( arr , x ): 
    lo =  0 
    hi = len ( arr ) -  1 
 
    while lo <= hi : 
        mid = ( lo + hi ) //  2 
 
        if x == arr [ mid ] and ( mid ==  0 or x != arr [ mid -  1 ] ): 
            return mid 
 
        elif x <= arr [ mid ]: 
            hi = mid -  1 
 
        else : 
            lo = mid +  1 
 
    return - 1 
 ``` 
 The corrected code has the following improvements : 
 
 * The ` hi ` variable is initialized to ` len ( arr ) -  1 ` instead of ` len ( arr )`. This is because the ` mid ` variable is used to index the array , and the ` mid ` value can be ` 0 `, which would cause an index error if ` hi ` is not adjust ed . 
 * The ` while ` loop condition is changed from ` lo < hi ` to ` lo <= hi `. This is because the ` mid ` value can be ` 0 `, which would cause an index error if ` lo ` is not adjust ed . 
 * The ` return ` statement is moved to the end of the function , after the ` while ` loop . This is because the ` return ` statement should only be executed if the loop is ex ited due to a successful search , and not if the loop is ex ited due to a failure to find the value . 
 
 Over all , the corrected code is function ally equivalent to the original code , but it is more robust and easier to read .
