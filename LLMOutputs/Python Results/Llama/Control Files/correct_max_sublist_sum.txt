    return max _ so _ far [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The return statement should be ind ented to the same level as the for loop . 
 2 . The variable " max _ ending _ here " is not initialized before it is used in the for loop . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 def max _ sub list _ sum ( arr ): 
    max _ ending _ here =  0 
    max _ so _ far =  0 
 
    for x in arr : 
        max _ ending _ here = max ( 0 , max _ ending _ here + x ) 
        max _ so _ far = max ( max _ so _ far , max _ ending _ here )
