The code seems to be correct syntactically but there are logical errors. The issue lies in the code fragment where it tries to combine the disjoint sets, but it does not actually annotate all the elements that belong to one set to another set properly, which causes the minimum spanning logic to potentially fail.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node, mst_edges = {}, set()

    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):
        u, v = edge
        group_1, group_2 = group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u}), group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v})
        if group_1 != group_2:
            mst_edges.add(edge)
            joined_group = group_1.union(group_2)
            for node in joined_group:
                group_by_node[node] = joined_group

    return mst_edges
```

In this corrected version, instead of updating only the sets of nodes `u` and `v`, we update groups of all nodes that are already in the same group as `u` and `v`. By doing this, we are properly maintaining the disjoint-set data structure, which is crucial for the correctness of the Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.

----- another analysis -----
The code above does not contain any syntax errors. However, it contains a semantical error.

The algorithm is supposed to calculate a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a graph. Within the code block iterating through sorted edges, the condition checks whether the nodes of the edge belong to different groups/set (hence they are not connected), if so, it connects them and updates the group of nodes accordingly. However, this is done in a wrong way, causing some nodes to belong to old groups.

Corrected version:

```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    mst_edges = set()

    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):
        u, v = edge
        group_u = group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u})
        group_v = group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v})
        if group_u != group_v:
            mst_edges.add(edge)
            new_group = group_u.union(group_v)
            for node in new_group:
                group_by_node[node] = new_group

    return mst_edges
```
In the corrected version, first, the groups of u and v (group_u and group_v) are found. If they are different, the edge is added to the MST, and the new_group is created by merging group_u and group_v. Then, for all nodes in the new_group, their groups in group_by_node are updated to be the new_group.
----- another analysis -----
There is a logical error in the code. When updating the `group_by_node` dictionary, both groups from `u` node and `v` node should be joined, but this code replaces `group_by_node[v]` with `group_by_node[u]`, which is not correct, because `group_by_node[v]`'s old group members are not updated to the new group. 

Let's correct it:

```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    mst_edges = set()

    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):
        u, v = edge
        u_group, v_group = group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u}), group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v})
        
        if u_group is not v_group:
            mst_edges.add(edge)
            u_group.update(v_group)

            for node in v_group:
                group_by_node[node] = u_group

    return mst_edges
```

Now, it is correct. Moreover, 'key=weight_by_edge.__getitem__' was replaced with 'key=weight_by_edge.get' for better readability.
----- another analysis -----
There do not seem to be any syntax errors or runtime errors in the code, so it should run correctly. However, the code's functionality can be problematic because of its treatment of graph nodes. When updating `group_by_node[v]` and `group_by_node[node]`, it causes multiple references of the same set of connected nodes to be maintained in `group_by_node`. Therefore, it would introduce inefficiency and potential bugs when finding MST for a larger, denser graph.

Instead, one should always update the group of each node to the same set, not just when merging two groups. Secondly, to avoid iterating over `group_by_node[v]` every time, use a helper map to record the set that each node currently belongs to.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    group_map = {}  # map node to its set
    mst_edges = set()

    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.__getitem__):
        u, v = edge
        group_u = group_by_node.setdefault(u, {u})
        group_v = group_by_node.setdefault(v, {v})
        if group_map.get(u, group_u) != group_map.get(v, group_v):
            mst_edges.add(edge)

            # merge the group of u and v
            merged_group = group_u.union(group_v)
            for node in merged_group:
                group_by_node[node] = merged_group
                group_map[node] = merged_group  # properly update group_map

    return mst_edges
```
In theory, one should use a disjoint set (also called union-find set) data structure to solve this kind of problem. It's more efficient and correct by design, but it will also require a total rewrite of this method.
----- another analysis -----
The code given is generally correct and will run without raising any unhandled exceptions. However, the logic of adding and updating groups is flawed and might not produce a correct result, when generating the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST).

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def minimum_spanning_tree(weight_by_edge):
    group_by_node = {}
    mst_edges = set()

    for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.get):
        u, v = edge
        if group_by_node.get(u, {u}) is not group_by_node.get(v, {v}):
            mst_edges.add(edge)

            if u in group_by_node:
                group_by_node[u].add(v)
                for node in group_by_node[u]:
                    group_by_node[node] = group_by_node[u]
            else:
                group_by_node[v].add(u)
                for node in group_by_node[v]:
                    group_by_node[node] = group_by_node[v]

    return mst_edges
```

In the original code, `setdefault` was used which causes incorrect group merging. The corrected code uses `get` for retrieval and manually merges the groups when a new edge is added. `is not` is used instead of `!=` to exactly match the groups, not just their contents.
