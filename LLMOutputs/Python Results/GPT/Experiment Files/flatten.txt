The only error in the code above is in the statement yield flatten(x) within the else block. This statement is unnecessary; the flatten function is recursively designed to handle array elements that are themselves, arrays. If the element is not an array, it should be yielded directly, rather than apply flatten function on it.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
```

This code works by defining a generator function, flatten, which takes as input an array, arr. If an element of arr is a list itself, the function recursively calls itself on that element to flatten the list. If an element is not a list, it is immediately yielded. This results in the original nested lists being "flattened" into a single list.

The logic in this code is almost correct but there's a small error in the usage of recursion.

Error: 

In the else statement, the function tries to run 'flatten' on a non-list 'x'. This will cause a TypeError during execution if x is not a list, as 'flatten' expects a list as its argument.

Corrected Code: 

def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x

Explanation:

The corrected function checks if each item in the array 'arr' is a list. If it is, it performs a recursive call on that list to flatten any nested lists. If it's not a list, the item is returned directly. This way, the function can handle any level of nested lists.
----- another analysis -----
The logic of the function is generally correct, but there's a mistake in the "else" branch of the "if" statement. The "else" branch tries to call the flatten function recursively on non-list elements which could cause a runtime error.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
```

In this version, if the current element is not a list, the function simply yields the element itself.

Error:

1. The function 'flatten' is called recursively within the yield statement when the iterable object isn't a list. This will cause an error as a non-list item cannot recursively be flattened.

Corrected Code:

```python
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
```

In this corrected version, when an item isn't a list, we simply yield the item instead of trying to flatten it.

Errors:

1. When the item 'x' is not a list, it yields flatten(x). It should yield 'x'. Yielding flatten(x) will produce an error because 'x' is not iterable.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
In the correct version, the function checks if the item 'x' is a list. If it is, the function calls itself recursively to flatten any nested lists. If 'x' is not a list, the function directly yields 'x'.
