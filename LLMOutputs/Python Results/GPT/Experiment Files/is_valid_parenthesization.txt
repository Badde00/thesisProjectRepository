The given code checks whether the sequence of parenthesis 'parens' is valid or not. If an opening parenthesis is encountered, it increases the 'depth' by 1 and if a closing parenthesis is encountered then it decreases the 'depth' by 1. If at any point, there are more closing parenthesis than opening parenthesises (if 'depth' is less than '0'), it directly returns False. But it doesn't check whether there are more opening parenthesis than closing ones in the end. The correct implementation should check whether 'depth' is 0 at the end.

Corrected code:

def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    depth = 0
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
            if depth < 0:
                return False

    return depth == 0
----- another analysis -----
The provided function does return False for strings containing more closing parentheses than opening, however, it fails to validate strings containing more opening parentheses than closing. This function should return False for not fully closed parentheses as well. The corrected version of the code is as follows:

```python
def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    depth = 0
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
            if depth < 0:
                return False
    return depth == 0
```
In this corrected version, the function will only return True if the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal and they are correctly placed, meaning there's no closing parentheses without a prior opening one (depth never goes below 0).
----- another analysis -----
The code provided is almost correct but it misses the last check which is to make sure that at the end of the string, all open parentheses have been closed. If not, the string is not a valid parenthesization.

So the error lies in not checking whether `depth` is 0 or not after finishing the iteration.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    depth = 0
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False

    return depth == 0
```

In this corrected version, the method will return `True` if and only if all the opening parentheses in the string have matching closing ones. If at the end of the string `depth` is not 0, this means there are unmatched opening or closing parentheses, and the function will then return `False`.
----- another analysis -----
The code above almost checks if a string contains a valid parenthesization. However, it has a logical error where it doesn't check if the number of opening brackets is equal to the closing brackets. 

A valid parenthesization means every opening bracket should have its corresponding closing bracket. But in the given code it will not be able to catch the cases where there are more opening brackets than closing brackets so it will not give correct output for example like "(".

Here is the corrected code,

```python
def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    depth = 0
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
            if depth < 0:
                return False
            
    return depth == 0
```

In the corrected code, `return depth == 0` at the end will handle those cases when there are more opening brackets than closing brackets. If there are more opening brackets, `depth` will be greater than 0, therefore `depth == 0` will return False indicating an invalid parenthesization.
----- another analysis -----
The code has logical error. It doesn't cover the case where open parentheses '(' are more than closing parentheses ')'. 

The corrected version of the code:

```python
def is_valid_parenthesization(parens):
    depth = 0
    for paren in parens:
        if paren == '(':
            depth += 1
        elif paren == ')':
            depth -= 1
            if depth < 0:
                return False
    return depth == 0
```

The fix adds a check after the loop making sure that the 'depth' is zero, which will mean every opened parenthesis has been closed appropriately. Also, the code now checks for closing parentheses specifically ')' and not any other character.
