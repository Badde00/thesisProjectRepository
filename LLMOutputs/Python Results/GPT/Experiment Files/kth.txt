The code seems to have a logic error. In the recursive call for the kth element of 'above' array, we must adjust the k by subtracting the count of 'below' elements and 1 (for the pivot), as those elements are guaranteed to be less than elements in 'above' array.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(arr) - len(above)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

The logic of the code seems correct as it aims to find the kth smallest number in the array by using the Quickselect algorithm. However, there's a off-by-one error. The k-index is zero-based, but the comparisons in the function behave as if it's one-based. 

Additionally, there is a missing case in the code. If multiple instances of the pivot exist, the 'above' array will not include them because the code only takes values > pivot. This will cause a problem when k is equivalent to any of these ignored instance's index.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = num_less + len(equal)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

In the original code, num_lessoreq is calculated as the number of elements in arr that are not greater than the pivot, i.e., it includes elements less than and equal to the pivot. This is corrected in the new version where we keep track of and separately handle elements equal to the pivot, which also allows handling duplicate values in the array.

The other major change is in the recursive call for the 'above'-case, where the corrected k becomes `k - num_lessoreq` to correctly handle the zero-based index.


----- another analysis -----
The errors in the code are:
1. The function fails to handle equal elements in the array properly.
2. When recursively calling the function for the 'above' array, the function doesn't adjust the 'k' parameter.

The corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    
    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(below) + len(equal)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

The function now handles equal elements properly by splitting the array into three parts: 'below', 'equal', and 'above' pivot. Also, when 'k' is greater than the number of 'less or equal' elements, we adjust 'k' by subtracting the 'num_lessoreq' value to ensure the proper indexing in the 'above' array.
----- another analysis -----
The code has kth of k-smallest element in array problem. There are two problems.

1. The kth index is not correct in the recursive function 'kth'. In the original recursive function call `kth(above, k)`, k is the index in the original array `arr`, but 'above' only contain elements larger than 'pivot'. 

2. The pivot needs to be appended to 'below' or 'above' list, but not both. The line `above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]` does not handle equals case. In case of duplicate pivot numbers in arr, only one occurrence of pivot is considered.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = num_less + len(middle)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

In the corrected code, 'pivot' is added into 'middle' list. Pivot is considered in the below list if k < num_less and in the above list if k >= num_lessoreq. The recursive function 'kth' is correctly called with `k - num_lessoreq` for 'above' array.
----- another analysis -----
The code given is generally correct. It is using the quickselect algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an array. The primary issue is in the last recursive call to kth function for 'above' array. If k is greater than the count of elements which are less than or equal to the pivot, it needs to call the function for elements above the pivot but we have to adjust k by subtracting the count of elements which are less than or equal to pivot.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(arr) - len(above)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

Additionally, this code doesn't handle the case when there are equal elements in the list which could be a pivot. To avoid this ambiguity, we could add an 'equal' list to handle this edge case but it's not a syntax error.
