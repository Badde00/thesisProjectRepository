The code provided looks mostly correct. Based upon available information, the depth-first search implementation seems accurate, presuming the usage of a node object with a "successors" property.

However, it contains an error where it fails to mark a node as visited when the node is visited. This can potentially lead to infinite loops if a cycle exists in the graph.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        nodesvisited.add(node)  # added this line to mark a node as visited
        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            return any(search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors)

    return search_from(startnode)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a line `nodesvisited.add(node)` to mark the node as visited in the `search_from` function.
----- another analysis -----
The code provided doesn't seem to have any syntax errors, it is correct way to do a depth-first search in Python. But, for the code to function properly, it assumes some conditions. The major constraints are:

1. It assumes `node` has a `.successors` attribute, which might not always be the case in every project.
2. The nodes' comparison is done with `is` operator which checks for objects identity (are they exactly the same object). If the nodes are custom objects it might be necessary to override the method `__eq__` in the node's Class.
3. `nodesvisited` should include nodes after they have been visited.

Regarding point 3, a corrected version can be:

```
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        elif node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            nodesvisited.add(node)
            return any(
                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors
            )

    return search_from(startnode)
```
----- another analysis -----
The provided code appears to be correct for a 'depth-first search' function in Python, provided 'node.successors' is a list of neighboring or child nodes of the current node in the graph tree. However, the current node is not being added to the 'nodesvisited' set, which might result in an infinite loop if there are circular paths in the graph. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        if node in nodesvisited:
            return False
        nodesvisited.add(node) # Node is added to nodes visited set
        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            return any(
                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors
            )

    return search_from(startnode)
```

In this corrected version, "nodesvisited.add(node)" is added to ensure that every node visited is stored in the 'nodesvisited' set. This prevents the function from looping infinitely over nodes that lead back to nodes already visited.

The given code doesn't seem to have any observable errors unless there are further specifications to the task. However, there seems to be a bug - if you've visited a node, you are not marking it as visited which could potentially lead to infinite loops.

Corrected code:

```python
def depth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    nodesvisited = set()

    def search_from(node):
        nodesvisited.add(node) # Add this line to mark nodes as visited.
        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            return any(
                search_from(nextnode) for nextnode in node.successors if nextnode not in nodesvisited
            )

    return search_from(startnode)
```

This code makes sure that you mark each node that you visit and you don't visit the same node more than once.
----- another analysis -----
The presented code has no errors. It is a proper implementation of the depth-first search algorithm for tree or graph-like structures. 

Before running the code, please make sure that the class of the input startnode and goalnode objects properly defines the property "successors" that represents the nodes connected to the given node. The code assumes that "successors" returns an iterable of connected nodes.
