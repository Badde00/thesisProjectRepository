The code above has a performance issue rather than a syntax or runtime error. It is creating a new set as well as checking for an item in a list inside the nested for loop. This could make the program run with a time complexity of about O(n^3) which is inefficient.

Here is an optimized version of the above code.

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    node_set = set(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if nextnode not in node_set and node_set.issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes):
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                node_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes
```
In this version, "node_set" is a set containing all nodes that have already been added to "ordered_nodes". It is used for faster checks if a node is already included in "ordered_nodes". We then add new nodes directly to "node_set" when they are added to "ordered_nodes" to keep both synchronized.

The major change here is the use of a set to replace the list when checking for presence, which alone could offer O(1) complexity, improving from the previous O(n), where n is number of "ordered_nodes". The second improvement is that, rather than regenerating "node_set" in each iteration, we update it each time a new node is added. This helps avoid unnecessary set re-creation.

The code gives the impression of trying to implement the concept of topological sorting, but it does not follow the standard algorithm for this task, which usually involves depth-first search and checking for cycles. 

Another noticeable issue is that it is 'set(ordered_nodes)' is calculated for each iteration of the inner loop which is an unnecessary overhead. 

A corrected version, using Depth-First Search (DFS):

```python
def topological_sort_util(v, visited, stack):
    visited.append(v)
    for node in v.outgoing_nodes:
        if node not in visited:
            topological_sort_util(node, visited, stack)
    stack.insert(0, v)

def topological_ordering(nodes):
    visited = []
    stack = []
    for node in nodes:
        if node not in visited:
            topological_sort_util(node, visited, stack)
    return stack
```

This proposed code uses a helper function `topological_sort_util()` that performs the actual depth-first search and places each visited node on a stack, with nodes that have no outgoing edges placed first. This results in a topological order when the nodes are popped from the stack. 

Note: This assumes that the provided graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). If the graph contains cycles, topological ordering is not possible and this code will result in incorrect output or an infinite loop.

Issues:

1. Processing time can be reduced by creating the set of 'ordered_nodes' just one time.
2. The code doesn't have a check for a circular dependency. Topological ordering is not possible if there is a circular dependency.
3. The sequence of the implementation results in adding the nodes without considering the true order of the precedence of tasks.

Corrected Code:

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    ordered_set = set(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if set(nextnode.incoming_nodes).issubset(ordered_set) and nextnode not in ordered_set:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                ordered_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes if len(ordered_nodes) == len(nodes) else []
```

Instead of checking if 'ordered_nodes' is a superset of 'nextnode.outgoing_nodes', we should check if 'ordered_set' is a superset of 'nextnode.incoming_nodes' because a node could only be processed if all its parent nodes have been processed. I have also added a set 'ordered_set' to reduce the time spent on existence checks.

Lastly, the function should return an empty list if there are nodes left unprocessed due to circular dependencies. The length of 'ordered_nodes' should be the same as the length of 'nodes' to ensure all nodes are processed.
----- another analysis -----
There are several potential issues with this code depending on what the input is expected to be like:

1. Potential inefficiency: The statement `set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes)` can be potentially inefficient because `set(ordered_nodes)` is constructed in each iteration.

2. Mutating the list while iterating: The code is appending to `ordered_nodes` while iterating over it which can cause unexpected behavior.

3. Infinite loop: If there is a cycle in your graph, this code would end up in an infinite loop. Topological sort is not possible for graphs with cycles.

Corrected code with simple algorithm and cycle detection is shown below:

```python
from collections import deque

def topological_ordering(nodes):
    # 'nodes' needs to be a dictionary where each key is a node and each value is a set of its successor nodes
    ordered_nodes, queue = deque(), {node: set() for node in nodes}
    incoming_edges = {node: 0 for node in nodes}
    
    # Prepare dictionary with count of incoming edges
    for node in nodes:
        for nextnode in nodes[node]:
            incoming_edges[nextnode] += 1
            
    # Get starting nodes
    for node, incoming in incoming_edges.items():
        if incoming == 0:
            ordered_nodes.append(node)
    
    # Process graph
    while ordered_nodes:
        current_node = ordered_nodes.popleft()
        for nextnode in queue[current_node]:
            incoming_edges[nextnode] -= 1
            if not incoming_edges[nextnode]:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
        queue.pop(current_node)
    
    # If there is a cycle,
    if queue:
        raise ValueError("The input graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).")
        
    return queue.keys()
```
Note: This implementation is based on Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting and checks for cycles by raising a ValueError when the graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG).

There is a major inefficiency issue in the code.

1. The main problem is with the line `if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:`. Converting the list to the set inside the loop can be very expensive since it is performed repetitively in each iteration.

To solve the issue, convert `ordered_nodes` to a set outside of the loop. 

```
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = {node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes}
    ordered_nodes_list = list(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes_list:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if ordered_nodes.issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
                ordered_nodes.add(nextnode)
                ordered_nodes_list.append(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes_list
```
Now `set` conversion is performed only once.

Also, note that the function assumes that its input, `nodes`, contains objects with incoming_nodes and outgoing_nodes properties, and that these properties correspond to collections of other such objects. This function will not work properly if these properties are absent or incorrect.
