The code provided has an infinite recursion error, because the base case where `coins` list is empty is missing. If the code is run and the coins do not add up to the total, the function will stuck in an endless loop. To fix this, we need to include this base case: if the `coins` list is empty and total is non-zero, we should return 0 (indicating that there's no possibility to make the total with given coins).

The corrected Python code is as follows:

```python
def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:
        return 0
    
    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
```

This code first checks whether the total is equal to zero, if yes, it returns 1 (one way to make zero amount is by taking no coins). If the total is less than zero or there are no more coins to use, it returns 0. Otherwise, it subtracts the first coin from the total and calls this function recursively with the new total and the same list of coins. Then it does the same thing but without the first coin in the list. Finally, it returns the sum of these two recursive calls. This is basically finding all possible combinations of coins which can add up to the given total.

This recursive python function doesn't have a base case to stop recursion when there are no more coins left to check. Also, if the function is called with a 'coins' parameter that is an empty list, it will raise an error when trying to unpack `first, *rest = coins`. 

Corrected Code:
```
# Python 3
def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:
        return 0

    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
```
In the corrected code, an extra condition is added for when there are no coins left. If `coins` is empty or `total` becomes less than zero then the function returns zero as there is no possible change that can be made in that case. Also, it now safely handles when `coins` is an empty list.
----- another analysis -----
The code is based on a concept to count the possibilities of obtaining a total value with use of coins. There is an error due to the fact that it might be stuck in an infinite recursive loop because it always sends the same coin list in the recursive calls. 

It may not affect the code in some conditions, but if the total gets less than the first coin in the list, it provokes infinite recursion since the first variation is kept repeating.

Here's a corrected version:

```python
# Python 3
def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:
        return 0

    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
```

The added condition `or not coins` is a check to bypass the possible infinite recursive loop and stop the function if there are no more coins to be used.
----- another analysis -----
The logic of the code seems to be finding possible combinations of coins to get to the total. However, calling `possible_change(coins, total - first)` will result in infinite recursion because if we don't have any coins that match the total, it will keep subtracting first until it passes zero and returns 0. Therefore, the code must be changed such that it only subtracts `first` if `total - first >= 0`.

Besides that, the code should also handle the case where the `coins` list is empty. If all coins have been used and none of them matched the total, it should return 0.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:
        return 0
    first, *rest = coins

    if total - first >= 0:
        return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
    else:
        return possible_change(rest, total)
```

In the corrected code, it checks if the `coins` list is empty or if the `total` is less than 0, at the beginning of the function. If `total - first >= 0`, then it subtracts `first` from `total` and makes a recursive call, otherwise, it simply makes a recursive call without subtracting `first`.
----- another analysis -----
The function `possible_change` goes into infinite recursion if `coins` contains a coin of value 0. If there are zero-value coins, they must be filtered out before the recursive calls. 

Additionally, it should also handle the case when `coins` variable is an empty list, because in such case the `first, *rest = coins` line of code will raise a ValueError.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
def possible_change(coins, total):
    coins = [coin for coin in coins if coin > 0]  # filter out zero-value coins
    
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0 or not coins:  # also return 0 if there are no coins left
        return 0

    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total)
```

This code firstly removes zero-value coins from the given coin list. After this change, recursive calls always decrease the value of `total` (if `first` is chosen) and the list of coins eventually becomes an empty list (if `first` is not chosen). Therefore, the recursion always ends. 

This function also now correctly handles the case when `coins` is an empty list, returning 0 when there are no available coins to make change.
