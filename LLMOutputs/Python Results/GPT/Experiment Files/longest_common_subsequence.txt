The function "longest_common_subsequence" does not produce the correct output because when "a[0] == b[0]", it removes only the first character from string a and it does not remove the first character from string b. This may cause wrong outputs, especially when there is repeating characters in string b for the same character that matches from string a.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''

    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])

    else:
        return max(
            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
            key=len
        )
```
In this corrected version, when "a[0] == b[0]" we remove the first character from both strings a and b. This avoids the mistake of considering the character in string b that already matched with string a in subsequent comparisons.

The code is expected to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two sequences. However, in the second case, it doesn't correctly handle the situation when the first characters of both sequences match — the rest of sequence 'b' stays the same, which can lead to repetitions or incorrect LCS.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''

    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])

    else:
        return max(
            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
            key=len
        )
```

In the corrected version, both 'a' and 'b' get their first character removed when they match, correctly identifying the LCS onwards for the remaining sequences.
----- another analysis -----
No errors have been identified in this code. It is a correct implementation of a simple recursive function for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two strings a and b. 

This implementation however has an exponential time complexity, which may cause performance issues on larger inputs. Edge cases such as a NoneType input might also not be handled properly. 

Here is a slightly modified version using dynamic programming to improve performance:

```
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if a is None or b is None:
        return ''

    lengths = [[0 for j in range(len(b)+1)] for i in range(len(a)+1)]
    for i, x in enumerate(a):
        for j, y in enumerate(b):
            if x == y:
                lengths[i+1][j+1] = lengths[i][j] + 1
            else:
                lengths[i+1][j+1] = max(lengths[i+1][j], lengths[i][j+1])

    result = ""
    x, y = len(a), len(b)
    while x != 0 and y != 0:
        if lengths[x][y] == lengths[x-1][y]:
            x -= 1
        elif lengths[x][y] == lengths[x][y-1]:
            y -= 1
        else:
            assert a[x-1] == b[y-1]
            result = a[x-1] + result
            x -= 1
            y -= 1
    return result
```
This implementation builds an n*m matrix (with n and m being the lengths of the input strings), and uses it to compute the longest common subsequence in O(n*m) time complexity. Additionally, it also checks and handles NoneType inputs.
----- another analysis -----
The provided Python function is intended to find the longest common subsequence between two given strings. Technically, there's one conceptual error in the code. When "a[0] == b[0]", the function should compare the rest of both strings, but in your case it's only comparing the rest of "a" against "b" which is not correct, it should compare "a[1:]" and "b[1:]". 

The corrected function would look like this:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''

    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])

    else:
        return max(
            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
            key=len
        )
```
Other than that, this function is correct but it can be quite inefficient for large strings due to its recursive nature. It can benefit from memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations.
----- another analysis -----
The code does not have any syntax errors, however it has a logical error. In the conditional statement where it checks if the first character in each string is the same, if true, it removes the first character from the first string only. It does not remove the matched character from the second string. This could lead to false positives in the result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):
    if not a or not b:
        return ''

    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])

    else:
        return max(
            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),
            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),
            key=len
        )
```
