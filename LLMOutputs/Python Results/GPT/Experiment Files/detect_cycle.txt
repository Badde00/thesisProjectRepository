The code itself does not contain any explicit syntax error, but there's a missed logical error. In this implementation for detecting a cycle in a linked list, we are not checking if the hare's second successor (i.e., `hare.successor.successor`) exists before assigning it to the hare. If the hare is at the end of the list, then calling `hare.successor.successor` will raise an AttributeError, indicating that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'successor'.

The corrected code would include a check for `hare.successor` before accessing `hare.successor.successor`.

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```

The code seems fine in general, but it doesn't take into account the case where `hare.successor.successor` is `None`. We need to check this to avoid `AttributeError`. This code assumes it is part of a LinkedList with `successor` as the next node. If it is not the case, then the attribute names might cause errors. 

This code also does not contain any type hinting or input validation, if those are desired.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    if node is None:                     # check if node
        return False

    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:     # check hare successor once and twice
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```

The code that you have provided appears to be a Python implementation of Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm). This algorithm is used to determine whether a cycle is present within a linked list.

The main issue with this code lies in the line `hare = hare.successor.successor`. Here, the program will likely run into an AttributeError in case where `hare.successor` is `None`.

To fix this, you need to add an additional check; if `hare.successor` or `hare.successor.successor` is `None`, return `False`, because there's no cycle if the end of the linked list is reached. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```

This code will not throw an AttributeError, and will correctly identify whether or not a cycle is present in the linked list.

This code seems to be fine, it is a Python implementation of Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (also known as the tortoise and the hare algorithm). However, the code might have a `NoneType` AttributeError when `hare.successor.successor` is None, ie., when there is just one item after the 'hare' in the list.

To cover this, we'll add an additional condition to the `if` statement:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```

This will return False when the hare or its successor is `None`, implying that there is no cycle. In fact, a better way would be to check for `None` even before the loop, and at both hare steps inside the loop. But let's keep this simple.

The code given is an implementation of Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, which detects cycles in a linked list. There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors; however, there could be a logical error. 

The line where the hare pointer moves two steps forward can cause a `NoneType' object is not iterable` error if there's no cycle and the list is finite. This would occur when hare.successor is the last node, and the code attempts to access hare.successor.successor which does not exist.

Here is the corrected code with added condition checks for hare's successor:

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor if (hare.successor is not None) else None

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```
