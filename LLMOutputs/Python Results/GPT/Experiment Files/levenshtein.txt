The function is meant to compute the Levenshtein distance (the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other) between two strings. However, there is a mistake in the recursion condition where it's comparing the first letter of both strings. If the first characters of both strings are the same, it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to perform an operation so we shouldn't return 1 + the function call.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '' or target == '':
        return len(source) + len(target)
    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target))
```

Now, when the first letters are the same, the function just continues with the rest of the strings, instead of adding one to the computed distance. Also, the base case should return the sum of the lengths of the two strings, not their logical OR, to accurately represent the amount of deletions required to turn one of the strings into an empty string.
----- another analysis -----
The implementation of the Levenshtein distance function given above is incorrect. The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one string into the other. Thus, when the first character of both strings is the same (second condition), there should not be any increment in the distance. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '':
        return len(target)
    if target == '':
        return len(source)
    if source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)
        )
```
The correction made here is to separate the checks for empty source or target. When one is empty, the Levenshtein distance is the length of the other. Also, if the first characters are the same, the algorithm proceeds to the next characters without adding to the distance. 

Please note that this is a naive recursive implementation of Levenshtein distance, and won't work well for large strings due its time complexity. One should use a dynamic programming approach for real-world applications.
----- another analysis -----
The Levenshtein distance implementation is incorrect. When the first characters of source and target are the same, the function does not need to increase the count.
Also, all possible operations (insertion, deletion and substitution) are not included in the case when the first characters of the source and target are different.

Corrected code:

```
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '':
        return len(target)
    if target == '':
        return len(source)
    if source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),    # insert
            levenshtein(source[1:], target),        # delete
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])     # replace
        )
```
In the corrected code, if the first characters of the source and target are the same, we're just moving to the next set of characters. If they're different, we're considering all three possible operations - insert, delete, and replace.

Issues: 

1. In the second "elif" condition - it should not return 1 + recursive call. It should be 0 as we are performing no operation if both characters are equal.
2. In the last condition - to calculate the correct Levenshtein distance the function should also be called for the case where neither of the characters are removed (levenshtein(source[1:], target[1])).

Corrected code:

```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '' or target == '':
        return len(source) + len(target)

    elif source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])

    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),    # delete
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),    # replace
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)         # insert
        )
```
----- another analysis -----
The code above is calculating the Levenshtein distance between two strings, which is a measure of the difference between two sequences. However, it contains an error.

Issue:

- The condition sequence is not correct. When source[0] == target[0], the function should not increment the count because no operation is needed to make the two letters identical.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def levenshtein(source, target):
    if source == '':
        return len(target)
    if target == '':
        return len(source)
    if source[0] == target[0]:
        return levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:])
    else:
        return 1 + min(
            levenshtein(source,     target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target[1:]),
            levenshtein(source[1:], target)
        )
```

Explanation:
Now, instead of checking if either source or target is empty and returning the length of either, the function checks if only source or target is empty and returns the length of the non-empty string. This fixes the issue of returning the wrong value when one of the strings is empty.
When source[0] == target[0], no increment is needed because they are already identical, so the function will just proceed to check the next characters.
