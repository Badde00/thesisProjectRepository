There are no syntactical errors in this code. It is a solution to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array. However, it may raise a KeyError in case "ends" dictionary does not contain a key corresponding to "length + 1" and this is rather an edge condition than a code error.  

To fix potential KeyError, I have added a check before accessing the "ends" dictionary.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def lis(arr):
    ends = {}
    longest = 0

    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
        prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]

        length = max(prefix_lengths) if prefix_lengths else 0

        if length == longest or (length + 1 in ends and val < arr[ends[length + 1]]):
            ends[length + 1] = i
            longest = length + 1

    return longest
```

No errors are found in the code. The code given is a correct implementation of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given array. 

When executed, this code will correctly iterate the given array, maintain a dictionary of the longest subsequence ending at each index, and return the length of the longest such subsequence.
----- another analysis -----
The code snippet provided is a function designed to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence from a list of integers. 

The code appears to be correct. 

It starts by initializing an empty dictionary and a counter for the longest sequence found so far. 

For each number in the list, it searches through the dictionary to find all increasing subsequences that end in a value less than the current number. It then extends the longest such subsequence by the current number.

In the last few lines of the `for` loop, it updates the value associated with the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` and possibly updates the longest sequence found so far.

As a result, this code does not contain any errors.

This code looks almost correct. However, it attempts to access `ends[length + 1]` when it's not necessarily guaranteed that `ends[length + 1]` exists, which may cause a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code considering the error:

```python
def lis(arr):
    ends = {}
    longest = 0

    for i, val in enumerate(arr):

        prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]

        length = max(prefix_lengths) if prefix_lengths else 0

        # check if ends[length + 1] exists before attempting to access it
        if length == longest or (length + 1 in ends and val < arr[ends[length + 1]]):
            ends[length + 1] = i
            longest = length + 1

    return longest
```

This code solves the longest increasing subsequence problem. The dictionary `ends` keeps track of the smallest end element of all increasing subsequences with length `i`, where `i` is the key and the value is the index of the end element. This code correctly returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The fix prevents potential `KeyError` by making sure `ends[length + 1]` exists before attempting to access it.

The provided code does not have any syntax errors. The code is an implementation of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a list of numbers. Though, it may throw a KeyError if 'length + 1' is not a key in the 'ends' dictionary, in line 'if length == longest or val < arr[ends[length + 1]]'. Here's a fixed version of the code with added condition to avoid KeyError:

```python
def lis(arr):
    ends = {}
    longest = 0

    for i, val in enumerate(arr):

        prefix_lengths = [j for j in range(1, longest + 1) if arr[ends[j]] < val]

        length = max(prefix_lengths) if prefix_lengths else 0

        if length == longest or (length + 1 in ends and val < arr[ends[length + 1]]):
            ends[length + 1] = i
            longest = length + 1

    return longest 
```

This won't avoid the KeyError but instead conditionally accesses that key when it is assured to exist in the dictionary.
