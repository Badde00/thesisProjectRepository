The error in the code lies in the innermost for loop where the formula length_by_path[i, j] is used to find the shortest path. The formula should be length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j] instead of length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k].

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
```

This code is implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is used for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but no negative cycles). The formula length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j] represents the possible new distance between two nodes i and j using another node k as an intermediary stage, and it should be compared with the current distance length_by_path[i, j] to determine the shortest path.
----- another analysis -----
The code seems to be implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. There is an error in the statement inside the loops. The code should check the distance between `i` to `k` and `k` to `j`, not `i` to `k` and `j` to `k`.

The corrected code is given below:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
```
----- another analysis -----
The code provided is wrongly calculating shortest path lengths because it is not applying Floyd-Warshall algorithm correctly. Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all-pairs shortest path is implemented incorrectly because in the nested loops, the calculation 

length_by_path[i, j] = min(length_by_path[i, j], length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k])

should be 

length_by_path[i, j] = min(length_by_path[i, j], length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]) 

You are comparing direct distance between i and j, to the sum of distance from i to k and then from k to j. It seems like, instead, you are summing up distances from i to k and j to k, which does not make sense.

Corrected code:

from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
----- another analysis -----
The provided code seems to be trying to implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing the shortest paths among all pairs of nodes in a graph. However, it has a logical error. In the innermost loop, `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]` must be corrected to `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]` to appropriately use the indirect path i->k->j. 

Here is the corrected version:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
```
----- another analysis -----
The code provided has logical errors. The direct path between two nodes i and j may not exist in length_by_edge input, but it is always accessed in the loop body. This will raise a KeyError in the Python language, even though the defaultdict avoids this for the length_by_path dictionary.

The computation also uses the wrong order of indices when trying to compute indirect distances, it should use length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j] instead of length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k].

The corrected code should then read:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]
                )

    return length_by_path
```

This corrected code correctly implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the lengths of shortest paths in a weighted graph with possible negative edge weights.
