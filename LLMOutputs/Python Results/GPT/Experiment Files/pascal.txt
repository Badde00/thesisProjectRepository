The code is pretty close to correct, but there is an error. There is no way to get the first element of each row as 1, because the code states that the "upleft" value should be 0 if c == 0. 

Corrected code:

```python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = [1] # Adjusted the code to start with 1 in each row
        for c in range(1, r):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        row.append(1) # This guarantees last element of each row is 1
        rows.append(row)

    return rows
```

This is better because it ensures first and last element of any row in the pascal triangle is always 1 which is a fundamental property of a pascal triangle.

The code above does not contain any errors in itself, however, it doesn't handle when n = 0 correctly. When n equals 0, it should return an empty list.

Here is the corrected version if it should handle n = 0.

```python
def pascal(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = []
        for c in range(0, r+1):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        rows.append(row)

    return rows
```

----- another analysis -----
The code provided is almost correct, but there's a small logical error regarding the Pascal's triangle algorithm. The first element of each row in the Pascal triangle is always 1, so you must manually add it before calculating the other elements.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for c in range(1, r):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        row.append(1)  # The last element of each row is also 1.
        rows.append(row)

    return rows
```

This version will correctly create Pascal's Triangle for the given number of rows 'n'.
----- another analysis -----
There is an error in the original code. In the Pascal's triangle, each number is a total of the two numbers directly above it. Thus, the last number of every row should also be 1. But in the given code, the last number of each row is not included which leads to incorrect outputs.

Corrected Code:

def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for c in range(1, r):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        row.append(1)
        rows.append(row)

    return rows

----- another analysis -----
The code you've provided is supposed to generate a pascal's triangle up to n rows but there is a logical error. The last row is not fully populated due to a logic error in the inner for loop. It only goes up to the row number minus one. So, it doesn't have the last number because it's missed off. This leaves off the '1' that should appear at the end of each row of Pascal's Triangle. The corrected version should be:

```python
def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for c in range(1, r):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        row.append(1)
        rows.append(row)
    return rows
```  

This modified code initiates every row with '1' and closes it with '1', which are the first and last elements respectively as per Pascal's Triangle rules. And the range of second loop is fixed to reach all necessary element indexes.
