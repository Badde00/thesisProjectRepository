The code is almost correct, but it would fail if all numbers in the list are negative. This is because the initial max_so_far and max_ending_here are set as 0. A small adjustment is needed in the processing of the for loop to reset max_ending_here if it is less than 0. Outside that, the logic for the problem seems to take care of the constraints correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def max_sublist_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = arr[0]
    max_so_far = arr[0]

    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return max_so_far
```

This algorithm is known as Kadane’s Algorithm. Here, `max_ending_here` is the maximum ending sum of subarray and `max_so_far` is global maximum. The algorithm well handles negative numbers as well by using `max(x, max_ending_here + x)` it always checks for the larger sum whether the current number `x` or the sum of current number and last subarray `max_ending_here + x`. If all numbers in the list are negative, max_sublist_sum function will return max number from the list.

There is one logical error in the given code.

The current implementation does not consider the situation when the sum of the subarray is less than 0. 

This algorithm is based on Kadane's algorithm, where if the sum of the current subarray increases the total so far, it is added to the total, else, it is discarded. In the current code, if a subarray has a negative sum, it still gets added to the total sum, which might decrease the potential maximum sum.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def max_sublist_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
```

There is logical mistake in the code. If "max_ending_here" goes negative at any index of the array, we're still carrying that sum to the next element. In the requirement of finding a maximum subarray sum, negative sums don't contribute in increasing the sum but decrease it. So, in such situations, we should start taking sum from zero again.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def max_sublist_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = 0
    max_so_far = 0

    for x in arr:
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x
        if(max_ending_here < 0):
            max_ending_here = 0
        elif max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here

    return max_so_far
```
In the corrected version, if the sum of the sublist (max_ending_here) becomes negative, we're neglecting it and setting it to zero. Then we start taking sum from zero at the next element in array which corrects our logic to find the maximum sublist sum.

The provided code seems correct. It finds the maximum sum of a sub-list in given list "arr" (known as Kadane's algorithm). This algorithm works by looking for all positive contiguous segments of the array, and keeping track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments.

However, this code doesn't correctly handle the case where all elements in array are negative. It would return 0 in that case, not the maximum negative value, which is incorrect. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def max_sublist_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = arr[0]
    max_so_far = arr[0]

    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return max_so_far
```
This revised version starts from the first element of the array and iterates through, updating the max_ending_here value to be either the current element, or the current element plus the previous max_ending_here value. Then it updates max_so_far if max_ending_here is greater than max_so_far. This handles the all-negative array correctly, returning the maximum negative value. This version also works for other situations just like the original one.
----- another analysis -----
The code provided does not have an error, it correctly calculates the maximum subarray sum in an array using Kadane's algorithm. However, it might not work correctly for negative numbers. If the array has all negative numbers, then the code will return 0 which may be misleading, since the maximum subarray sum here is not 0 but the maximum of these negative numbers.

Here is an improved version:

```python
def max_sublist_sum(arr):
    if not arr: 
        return 0

    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]

    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

    return max_so_far
```
In this version of the code, `max_ending_here` is initialized as the first element of the array, `arr[0]`. Then for each `x` in `arr`, we replace `max_ending_here` with the larger of `x` or `max_ending_here + x`. This way, we ensure that even if all numbers in the array are negative, the maximum number among these negative numbers will be returned.
