The code has a logical error. In the inner loop, it has a condition "if perm[j] < perm[i]". However, to get the next permutation, it should be "if perm[j] > perm[i]". Once this condition is met, it would swap perm[i] and perm[j] and reverse the sequence after position i.

Here is the corrected code:

```
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:   # Edit this line
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm
```

This logic checks for the next higher permutation of a given sequence.
However, it seems this function doesn't consider the case when the list is already at the highest permutation. In that case, the function returns None. If you would like to return the lowest permutation (sorted list) when you're at the highest permutation, add the following code at the end of the function:

```
    return sorted(perm)
```

The logic inside the second for loop is incorrect. In order to find the next permutation, we need to swap the first pair of adjacent elements in reverse order (i1, i2) that i1 is less than i2. And then, we need to find the first element larger than i1 after the swap, but in the if condition, it is currently checking if the element is less than i1, indicating a wrong comparison.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:    # Corrected condition
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm 
```

Also, this function is missing a return statement for the scenario where there is no next permutation (i.e., the input is the largest permutation). For such scenarios, you may want to return the input permutation or notify that there is no next permutation.

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:    # Corrected condition
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm
    return None # return the input or Signal that there is no next permutation
```
----- another analysis -----
The function is intent to generate the next permutation of a given permutation in lexicographic order, but there is a logic error in the inner for-loop. The code tries to swap `perm[i]` and `perm[j]` when `perm[j]` is less than `perm[i]`, but it should do the swap when `perm[j]` is greater than `perm[i]`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:    # change this
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm
```

If there's no next permutation, the function does not return anything. Hence, it's recommended to add a line at the end to return the original permutation when no next permutation can be found:

```python
return perm
```
----- another analysis -----
The code seems to have a logical error. The inner loop should check if `perm[j] > perm[i]`. But it checks if `perm[j] < perm[i]`.
Also, the function doesn't return anything if no next permutation is found. It should return the initial permutation in this case. 

Below is the corrected version of code:

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[j] > perm[i]:
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm
    return perm
```
----- another analysis -----
The code above provides a correct implementation of the next permutation algorithm, but there is a logical error at line 5. The condition `if perm[i] < perm[j]:` should be changed to `if perm[i] < perm[j]:`, as we need to switch `perm[i]` with a number that is larger and directly after it. Also, the code does not return anything in case it can't find the next permutation (when the input permutation is the last possible one).

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def next_permutation(perm):
    for i in range(len(perm) - 2, -1, -1):
        if perm[i] < perm[i + 1]:
            for j in range(len(perm) - 1, i, -1):
                if perm[i] < perm[j]:
                    next_perm = list(perm)
                    next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = next_perm[j], next_perm[i]
                    next_perm[i + 1:] = reversed(next_perm[i + 1:])
                    return next_perm
    return None  # returns None if there is no next permutation
```

This logical error was preventing the code from correctly finding the next permutation of the sequence. In addition, the lack of a return statement at the end of the function is problematic when no next permutation can be found.
