Here is a list of some potential issues:

1. If n is not 1 and has no factors (i.e., n is a prime number), this function will return an empty list, making it seem like n has no factors, while in reality it should at least return n itself as a factor.

2. The above logic flaw can also cause an infinite recursion for prime numbers. When a prime number is passed in, the function won't find any factors, and will end up calling get_factors(n // i) with the same number recursively.

3. Not concerning the substantive errors, the function does not handle the case for n <= 0.

A corrected version of the code could be:

```
def get_factors(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i:
            continue
        return [i].append(get_factors(n // i))
    return [n]
```
In the corrected version, the function now handles n <= 1 gracefully, and it correctly returns [n] when n is a prime number (i.e., it has no factors other than 1 and itself). The corrected version also avoids the infinite recursion problem, as it breaks the loop upon finding a factor. The function's correctness can be easily proved by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be factorized as a product of prime numbers).

The code is logically incorrect. It won't work properly if the input number is a prime number or 1 because these cases aren't handled correctly. 

Also, the logic in the for loop is incorrect - it will not return all the factors of a number. Instead, it "stops" and returns as soon as it finds the first factor. 

Here's a corrected version:

```python
def get_factors(n):
    factors = [1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)

    return factors
```

This version creates a list, initializes it with 1 as 1 is a factor of all numbers, then runs a loop from 2 through the given number. If the number is divisible by the current loop counter, it appends the counter to the list. After the loop, it returns the full list of factors.

Your version with recursion also seems you want a list of prime factors not all factors, here is the correct version if you want a list of prime factors:

```python
def get_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

This corrected version starts from 2 and continues until the square of the factor being checked exceeds the number we're checking. If the number is divisible by the current factor, the function divides by that factor, and adds that factor to the list. When there are no more identical factors to divide out, the function increments the factor to check. If there is still a remainder after all identical factors are divided out (i.e., the number we're checking is greater than 1), then that remainder must be a prime factor, so it is also added to the list. This function will return a list of prime factors.
----- another analysis -----
The code functions correctly for the purpose of returning factors of a number, but it doesn't return the number itself as a factor. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    if n != 1:  # the remaining n is also a factor
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
In the original code, it stops and returns the moment it finds the first factor, not taking into account factors of the divide operation `n // i`. The corrected code continues to divide `n` by `i` while it is divisible and keeps appending `i` to the factors list. This will account for factors that appear more than once (for instance, 2 appears three times in the prime factorization of 8). 

Also, if `n` is not equal to 1 after the loop, `n` is also a prime factor of the original number and is appended to the list of factors.
----- another analysis -----
There are no syntax errors in the given code. But there may be a logic error, depending on the exact usage of this function.

This function is designed to return the prime factorization of the given number as a list. But if you want to get all factors (not just prime factors), then this function will not return correct results.

Also, if the number is a prime number, this function unfortunately will return an empty list, making it difficult to distinguish between 1 (which has no prime factors) and prime numbers (which are prime factors of themselves). 

Corrected version could look like this:

```python
def get_prime_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []

    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return [i] + get_prime_factors(n // i)
            
    return [n]  # The number itself is a prime number
```

If you want to return all factors (not just prime factors):

```python
def get_all_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                factors.append(n // i)
    return sorted(factors)  # Sorted for convenience
```
----- another analysis -----
The function provided is used to calculate the prime factors of a given number 'n'. It doesn't return a correct list of factors when 'n' is a prime number, and it also doesn't handle factorization for 'n' equal to 1 correctly, since '1' is a factor of every number.

The corrected version of the code would be:

```
def get_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Brief explanation:

This particular version of the function will split any number 'n' down into its prime factors correctly. It uses a while loop that runs as long as 'i' squared is not larger than 'n' (as no factor will be larger than this), incrementing 'i' if it is not a factor, else dividing 'n' by 'i' and adding 'i' to the factors list. After the loop, if what is left of 'n' is greater than 1, it is added to the factors list, as it is a factor itself. In the end, the function returns the list of factors.
