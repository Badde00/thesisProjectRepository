This code contains a couple of logical errors:

1. Instead of updating the 'weights' in 'weight_by_edge' (a clear logical error since 'weight_by_edge' is supposed to be the input graph), it should update 'weight_by_node'.

The corrected code is below:

```python
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    weight_by_node = {
        node: float('inf') for edge in weight_by_edge for node in edge
    }
    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for _ in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            if weight_by_node[u] + weight < weight_by_node[v]:
                weight_by_node[v] = weight_by_node[u] + weight

    return weight_by_node
```

2. The initial 'weight_by_node' dictionary is generated incorrectly. The code assumes the 'weight_by_edge' dictionary is of the form {(u, v): weight}, but then tries to generate 'weight_by_node' as if 'weight_by_edge' is of the form {(u, v)}. It needs to account for both nodes in each edge when initializing 'weight_by_node'.

Errors:

1. When defining weight_by_node, there is no option to handle one edge connecting to multiple nodes.
2. Inside the second loop, weight_by_edge should be weight_by_node.
3. We should check if 'u' is in weight_by_node before attempting to use it to prevent a KeyError.

Corrected Code:

```python
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    weight_by_node = {}
    for edge, weight in weight_by_edge.items():
        u, v = edge
        weight_by_node[u] = min(weight_by_node.get(u, float('inf')), weight)
        weight_by_node[v] = min(weight_by_node.get(v, float('inf')), weight)

    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for edge, weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            u, v = edge
            if u in weight_by_node and v in weight_by_node:
                weight_by_node[v] = min(
                    weight_by_node[u] + weight,
                    weight_by_node[v]
                )

    return weight_by_node
``` 

Explanation: We have to make sure that the weight_by_node dictionary is structured correctly before looping through it. Min function is used to update the weight only if it's smaller than the existing one. We also ensure that 'u' is in weight_by_node before using its value in the min function to prevent potential errors.
----- another analysis -----
There are several errors in the code:

1. The comprehension at the start is possibly incorrect and may throw a ValueError. We are assuming `weight_by_edge` is a dictionary with keys being tuple pairs when we do `for u, v in weight_by_edge`. This needs to be confirmed or changed based on actual structure of `weight_by_edge`.

2. The assignment on the line `weight_by_edge[u, v] = min(
                weight_by_node[u] + weight,
                weight_by_node[v]
            )` is wrong as we are not supposed to modify our input weight_by_edge.

3. Not all distances will be updated due to the first loop. The outer loop should run `len(weight_by_node)` times, not `len(weight_by_node) - 1`.

Assuming `weight_by_edge` is a dictionary with keys as `(u,v)` tuples and values as weight, here is the corrected version:

```
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    weight_by_node = {v: float('inf') for u, v in weight_by_edge.keys()}
    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for i in range(len(weight_by_node)):
        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            if weight_by_node[v] > weight_by_node[u] + weight:
                weight_by_node[v] = weight_by_node[u] + weight

    return weight_by_node
```

Explanation: 

1. In the corrected code, we avoid messing up with the input dictionary `weight_by_edge` and only update `weight_by_node` dictionary.

2. According to the Bellman-Ford algorithm (which this code is implementing), all nodes need to be processed `len(weight_by_node)` times not `len(weight_by_node) - 1` as the original code does, to ensure that all shortest paths are found.

3. The code now reflects the correct use of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
----- another analysis -----
1. Error: `weight_by_edge` is assumed to be a dictionary but also used as a list in the first for-loop.
2. Error: The fourth line of the script may cause KeyError if not all nodes can be found as `v` while unpacking `u, v`. We should collect all nodes and assign `inf` to them initially.
3. Error: The variable `weight_by_edge` should not be mutated in the nested for-loop. For updating shortest paths, `weight_by_node` should be modified.
4. Error: This function is probably intended for implementing the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest path on a graph. If that's the case, you would also need to check for negative weight cycles after main for-loop.

Here's the corrected version of the script:

```python
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    # Collecting all nodes
    nodes = set()
    for u, v in weight_by_edge.keys():
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)

    weight_by_node = {node: float('inf') for node in nodes}
    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            if weight_by_node[u] + weight < weight_by_node[v]:
                weight_by_node[v] = weight_by_node[u] + weight

    # Check for negative weight cycles
    for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
        if weight_by_node[u] + weight < weight_by_node[v]:
            raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")

    return weight_by_node
```

Please note that this code does not handle unconnected components. To fully implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm, you would start the algorithm anew from any node that remains of distance `inf` after running the algorithm once.
----- another analysis -----
The original code has the following issues:

1. Creating a dictionary with infinite initial weights using `weight_by_edge` as `for u, v in weight_by_edge` instead of iterating over `weight_by_edge.keys()`.
2. Attempting to calculate and update the shortest path from a source to all other nodes but the calculation and assignment are done on the wrong variable (`weight_by_edge` instead of `weight_by_node`).

Here is a corrected version:

```python
def shortest_paths(source, weight_by_edge):
    weight_by_node = {
        v: float('inf') for u, v in weight_by_edge.keys()
    }
    weight_by_node[source] = 0

    for i in range(len(weight_by_node) - 1):
        for (u, v), weight in weight_by_edge.items():
            weight_by_node[v] = min(
                weight_by_node[u] + weight,
                weight_by_node[v]
            )

    return weight_by_node
```

In this corrected version, initial weight dictionary is created correctly by iterating over `weight_by_edge.keys()` and shortest path logic is now correctly assigned to the `weight_by_node` dictionary.
