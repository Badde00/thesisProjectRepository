Errors:

1. When the function is flipping digits from 9 to 0, it doesn't account for the condition where this "carrying" should propagate to the digits to the left.
2. The function isn't creating a palindrome because the digits in both halves are not mirrored; digits in the lower half should mirror the corresponding digits in the higher half, but that isn't happening currently.

Corrected version:

```python
def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    high_mid = len(digit_list) // 2
    low_mid = (len(digit_list) - 1) // 2
    carry = 1 

    # iterating from middle towards the ends
    while low_mid >= 0:

        # if a carry exists
        if carry: 
            digit_list[low_mid] += carry
            carry = digit_list[low_mid] // 10 # get the new carry
            digit_list[low_mid] %= 10  # get the remainder for the middle digit

        # mirroring the digits
        digit_list[-(low_mid + 1)] = digit_list[low_mid]  

        low_mid -= 1

    # if a carry still remains, prepend and append a 1
    if carry:
        digit_list = [1] + digit_list + [1]

    return digit_list
```

This function now properly propagates the carry if required, and creates a palindrome out of the digit list.

Issues:
1. The purpose of the function seems to be to convert a list representation of a number into the next larger palindrome, but the current approach is flawed. Palindrome requires mirroring of digits around the middle, which is not being done here.
2. When both digits are 9 and set to 0, no carry is passed to the next higher order of digit, causing incorrect results.

Corrected Code:

```python
def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    length = len(digit_list)
    left, right = length // 2 - 1, (length + 1) // 2
    while left >= 0 and digit_list[left] == digit_list[right]:
        left, right = left - 1, right + 1
    if left < 0 or digit_list[left] < digit_list[right]:
        left, right = length // 2 - 1, (length + 1) // 2
        carry = 1
        while left >= 0:
            carry, digit_list[left] = divmod(digit_list[left] + carry, 10)
            digit_list[right] = digit_list[left]
            left, right = left - 1, right + 1
        if carry > 0:
            digit_list = [1] + digit_list + [1]
    else:
        while left >= 0:
            digit_list[right] = digit_list[left]
            left, right = left - 1, right + 1
    return digit_list
```
In the corrected code, this function converts digit_list into the next palindrome larger than digit_list. Works for digit_list with even and odd lengths. Mirrors around the center of digit_list and deals with the edge cases properly (e.g., carry when creating a new digit at the center).

There don't appear to be any syntax errors in the code. However, the logical correctness of the code depends on its intended behavior, which hasn't been stated. 

The function takes a list of digits and manipulates them based on rules for finding a "next_palindrome", but it's not clear what algorithm is being followed to define a "next palindrome". Therefore, it's difficult to recommend specific corrections. 

One possible issue of logic is that the function seems to assume that the input numbers are symmetric, and that may lead to incorrect results. 

The code also ignores the remaining digits when 9 is encountered, which may not lead to a valid palindrome for some inputs. For example, for the input [1, 9, 1], it would update the 9 to 0, neglecting the symmetry and resulting in an invalid [0,0,1] answer. 

The code could be made clearer and more generally correct with additional logic to iterate the remaining digits. For example:

```python
def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    n = len(digit_list)
    mid = n // 2
    left = n % 2
    i = mid - 1
    j = mid + left
    while i >= 0 and digit_list[i] == digit_list[j]:
        i -= 1
        j += 1
    if i < 0 or digit_list[i] < digit_list[j]:
        i = mid - 1
        carry = 1
        while i >= 0:
            temp = digit_list[i] + carry
            carry = temp // 10
            digit_list[i] = temp % 10
            digit_list[j] = digit_list[i]
            i -= 1
            j += 1
    else:
        while i >= 0:
            digit_list[j] = digit_list[i]
            i -= 1
            j += 1
    return digit_list
```

The given code appears to be trying to find the next palindrome number given a list of digits. However, it has a significant error. It will not mirror the left and right parts of the list. Additionally, it will not work if dealing with the number containing all "9"s. 

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def next_palindrome(num_list):
    def mirror(lst):
        n = len(lst)
        for i in range(n//2):
            lst[n-i-1] = lst[i]
        return lst

    n = len(num_list)
    left = num_list[:n//2]
    middle = num_list[n//2] if n % 2 == 1 else []
    right = num_list[n//2 if n%2 == 1 else n//2 + 1:]

    if right < left[::-1]:
        num_list = mirror(num_list)
    elif middle < [9]:
        num_list = left + [middle + 1] + left[::-1]
    else:
        while left and left[-1] == 9:
            left.pop()
        if not left:
            num_list = [1] + [0]*(n-1) + [1]
        else:
            left[-1] += 1
            num_list = left + [0]*(n//2) + left[::-1]
    return num_list
```

Explanation: Above code first computes the mirror value of the number, if right part is less than reversed left part then it returns the mirrored value else it increases the middle one by 1 and if it is "9" then it treats it like carry and adjust other digits accordingly. If all digits are "9" then it increases its length and makes first and last digit "1" and others "0".

The code looks fine in terms of syntax but, it doesn't seem to actually be doing what it claims - finding the next palindrome. However, it seems like it's trying to mirror digits (making both halves of the list same). Considering this as requirement, there is an error. The code doesn't mirror the digits. It changes both the left and right digits simultaneously which should not be the case.

Here is the correction for mirroring the digits:

```python
def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    high_mid = len(digit_list) // 2
    low_mid = (len(digit_list) - 1) // 2
    while high_mid < len(digit_list) and low_mid >= 0:
        if digit_list[high_mid] != digit_list[low_mid]:
            digit_list[high_mid] = digit_list[low_mid]
        high_mid += 1
        low_mid -= 1
    return digit_list
```

If you want to find next palindrome, the logic compeletely changes and it's more complex. You should consider edge cases and it depends on more conditions. Here is a sample of finding next palindrome:

```python
def next_palindrome(num):
    numstr = str(num)
    for i in range(num+1, 2*num):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            return i

print(next_palindrome(123))
```
This function converts the given number into a string and finds the next palindrome number by checking if string of the number is the same when reversed.
