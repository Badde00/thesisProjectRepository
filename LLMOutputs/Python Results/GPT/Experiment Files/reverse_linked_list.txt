The main error in this code is that it is assumed that the next node is accessed by `.successor`, which is not a built-in Python linked list attribute. The built-in attribute to get the next node in a linked list in Python is usually `.next`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
```

This function now properly takes a linked list node as input and returns the head of the reversed linked list.

This code seems to be a correct implementation for reversing a singly linked list in Python, with the assumption that the linked list element has an attribute named "successor" which holds a reference to the next node in the list. However, if the attribute name of next node in the list is different, then the script would raise an AttributeError. 

You will need to replace "successor" with the appropriate attribute name for the linked list node's next element. 

It's better to add some error checking and description as well:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, nextnode=None):
        self.value = value
        self.nextnode = nextnode

def reverse_linked_list(node):
    if not isinstance(node, Node):
        raise ValueError('Input must be of Node type.')

    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.nextnode
        node.nextnode = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
```

The Node class is defined here for demonstration purposes, the actual class may differ. If the structure of the Node class is different, this code would have to be modified accordingly.

The code appears to be correct at first glance, but an error could occur depending on the programming language and the specific linked list implementation used.

The error lies within the implementation of linked list in the code:
- In many cases, the pointer to the next node in a linked list is referred to as `next` or `nextNode`. Here it is `successor`; which is not a standard naming, which may cause name inconsistencies when trying to apply this function to most linked list objects.
- This function assumes that the linked list node has a `.successor` attribute, but not all linked list implementations have that.

Here is how the code might look like in Python if we assume that the next node is represented by `next`:

```python
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
```

The explanation of the corrections are as follows:
- Renamed `successor` to `next` for better compatibility with common linked list implementations.
- This function would reverse the order of the nodes in a singly linked list. It does this by iteratively changing the `next` pointers of the nodes to point to the previous node, until the entire list points in the opposite direction.

Note that error reporting and correction can significantly vary depending on the context.
----- another analysis -----
The given code doesn't seem to have any syntax error. But this code has some hidden logical errors due to the use of non-standard attributes for linked list nodes. Normally in Python, linked list node typically has 'next' for its pointer to next node, not 'successor'. If it's not standard naming, you should provide additional explanations or comments for it.

Here is the corrected version according to commonly used Python naming conventions:

```python
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
```

This corrected version consistently uses 'next' as the attribute name for the link to the next node. We also moved the line 'prevnode = node' after the update of 'node.next' because we need to complete all the operations related to the current 'node' before we move 'prevnode' to point to it.
----- another analysis -----
The given code seems fine assuming that 'successor' is correctly used for pointing to the next node in a linked list. However, in many traditional implementations of linked list, 'next' is used instead of 'successor'. So, it can be considered as an error if the object ‘node’ does not possess an attribute named 'successor'. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode

Please note that the corrected version assumes that each node object has a property called 'next'. The actual perceived accuracy of this code depends upon the specific implementation details of the linked list node used in the software project.
