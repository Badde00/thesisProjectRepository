The given code is meant to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all primes up to a given number. The algorithm maintains a list of candidate numbers (2 through max) and iteratively marks the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. However, this code has a logic error in the if statement.

Error:
1. The line `if any(n % p > 0 for p in primes):` should be `if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):`. 'any' should be replaced with 'all' because a number is prime only if it is not divisible by any previous prime number, not if it is not divisible by at least one previous prime number. 

Corrected Code:

```python
def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes
```

The logic for checking the primality of a number in the original code is flawed. The condition "if any(n % p > 0 for p in primes)" is incorrectly checking if there exists a prime number in the list "primes" such that "n" is not divisible by that prime. This would result in incorrect results since the condition should actually check if "n" is not divisible by all the primes in the list.

Corrected code:

def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes

Here, the corrected code correctly checks if "n" is not divisible by any of the primes in the list. If the condition "all(n % p > 0 for p in primes)" is true, "n" is a prime number and is appended to the list "primes".

The code provided is almost correct but contains a logical error in the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The 'if' condition statement is supposed to check if 'n' is divisible by any of the 'p' (primed numbers), and only if it is not, it is supposed to add 'n' into the list of primes.

The correct code should be:

def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes

In this case, all() is used instead of any() because all numbers 'n' must not be divisible by any existing prime 'p' for 'n' to be a prime. If any 'n' is divisible by any 'p' meaning n%p == 0, it should not be added to the list of primes.

The intent of the function is to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes which is used to find all primes upto a given number. However, it is incorrectly implemented.

Errors:
1. The condition in the `if` statement inside the loop is wrong. It checks if `n` is not a multiple of any element in `primes`, which is not the correct condition for a number to be prime. A number `n` is prime if and only if it is not a multiple of any prime number less than `n`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes
```

Here, `all(n % p > 0 for p in primes)` checks whether `n` is not a multiple of any of the primes less than `n`, which is the correct condition for `n` to be a prime number.

This code aims to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is an algorithm to find all primes less than a given number. However, it contains a logical error.

The error:
1. The 'if' condition inside the loop checks if 'n' is not divisible by all primes less than 'n'. But it should check 'n' is divisible by any prime less than 'n'.

The corrected code:

def sieve(max):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, max + 1):
        if all(n % p != 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(n)
    return primes

In the corrected code, the 'if' condition checks if 'n' is not divisible by any of the previously found primes. This means 'n' is a prime number and it appends 'n' to the 'primes' list.
