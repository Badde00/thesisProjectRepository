The code is meant to count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number. Unfortunately, the operation of XOR doesn't correctly isolate the rightmost 1 bit in order to count it. The correct operation would be a bitwise AND between 'n' and 'n - 1'.

Corrected code:

```python
def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        n &= n - 1
        count += 1
    return count
```

This works because the expression "n-1" effectively sets the value of the least significant '1' bit in 'n' to '0'. With each iteration of the loop, the operation "n &= n - 1" strips off the lowest set bit of 'n', until 'n' is eventually 0. Each time you perform this operation, you increment your count, thus giving the correct bit count in binary representation. 

For example, if n is 7, its binary representation is 111. When you do n-1, it results in 110, and when you do a bitwise AND with 111 and 110, it gives 110. You can see that the least significant '1' is stripped off. After this, n is 6 which in binary is 110. When you do n-1, it results in 101. Again doing a bitwise AND with 110 and 101 gives 100. So the least significant '1' is stripped off and count is incremented. We follow the similar steps until n becomes 0. For the given input 7, the function will return 3 as there are three 1's in its binary representation.

There is no error in this code. It correctly counts the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the binary representation of an integer number, `n`. By using the bitwise XOR operation `n ^= n - 1`, it flips the least-most (right-most) bit that is set (1), reducing the number of set bits until `n` becomes 0. The `while` loop counts how many times this operation is performed, which equals to the number of set bits in original `n`.

The code is correct, and it is used to count the total number of set bits in a binary representation of a number. No errors found. However, if desired, the purpose of the code could be more accurately conveyed using a more descriptive function name and comments.

Here is the version with added comments:

```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    # initialize the counter
    count = 0

    # loop until n becomes 0
    while n:
        # perform the bitwise XOR operation after subtracting 1 from n, which removes a set bit from the binary representation of n
        n ^= n - 1

        # increment the counter
        count += 1

    # return the total number of set bits
    return count
```

The given code is intended to count the number of set bits (1s) in binary representation of a given integer n. However, there is a logical issue with the `n ^= n - 1` operation which doesn't correctly reduce the bits in n.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def bitcount(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        n &= n - 1
        count += 1
    return count
```

Explanation: 

In the corrected version, `n &= n - 1` is used instead of `n ^= n - 1`. The operation `n &= n - 1` has the effect of 'removing' the lowest set bit in `n`. `n ^= n - 1` does not reliably do this - it performs a bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `n - 1` which will not necessarily remove the lowest set bit of `n`. 

Consequently, `n &= n - 1` correctly reduces number of set bits in `n` one by one from right to left, providing correct count of set bits in `n`.
----- another analysis -----
The code is for counting the number of set bits (1s) in a binary representation of a number 'n'. The code seems to be correct. There doesn't appear to be any syntax or logical errors in it.

It works by flipping the least significant bit of 'n' that is set to 1 to 0 in each iteration, until 'n' becomes 0. It increments the count in each iteration, thus effectively counting the number of 1s in the binary representation of 'n'.
