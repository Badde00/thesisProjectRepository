The current function tries to heapify a slice of the array that takes from the start to the k element, then for every element of the array it tries to push it to the heap and pop the smallest one, then when all elements have been processed it tries to pop every element from the heap. The error in the code is that it is considering every element of the array in the for loop which includes the already heapified first 'k' elements. 

The corrected version of the code is:

```python
def kheapsort(arr, k):
    import heapq

    heap = arr[:k+1]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    for x in arr[k+1:]:
        yield heapq.heappushpop(heap, x)

    while heap:
        yield heapq.heappop(heap)
```
In the corrected version, we start to push and pop elements to the heap starting at k+1 index, thus skipping the first 'k' elements already processed. We also initialize the heap with 'k+1' elements to ensure that in the heapify process we are including 'k' elements.

Error:
The first 'k' elements in the array 'arr' are processed twice in the heap: once when the initial heap is created and once more in the for loop.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def kheapsort(arr, k):
    import heapq

    heap = arr[:k]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    for x in arr[k:]:
        yield heapq.heappushpop(heap, x)

    while heap:
        yield heapq.heappop(heap)
```

In this adjusted version, the heap is initially created with the first 'k' elements from the array. Afterwards, the for loop processes the remaining elements from 'arr' starting from index 'k'. This way, the first 'k' elements are not processed twice.
----- another analysis -----
The kheapsort function provided is flawed in the sense that it starts sorting from the very beginning of the list. Here's the corrected version.

```python
def kheapsort(arr, k):
    import heapq

    heap = arr[:k] 
    heapq.heapify(heap) 

    for x in arr[k:]: # Start from kth element of array
        yield heapq.heappushpop(heap, x) 

    while heap:
        yield heapq.heappop(heap)
```
The fix involves changing the `for` loop to start iteration from the (k+1)th element, since first 'k' elements are already entered into the heap. This approach ensures elements only get added to the heap if they are greater than the smallest 'k' elements seen so far.
----- another analysis -----
The code doesn't contain any syntax errors, but there's a logical error. The issue is the logic in the algorithm doesn't correctly implement k-heapsort. It should first consider 'k' elements in the heap and only then start pushing and popping in the heap to maintain the size of the heap as 'k'. But here it starts doing that from the first element itself which would result in an incorrect sort.

Corrected code:

```python
def kheapsort(arr, k):
    import heapq

    heap = arr[:k]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    for x in arr[k:]:  # 'k' element heap already created, start from kth index.
        yield heapq.heappushpop(heap, x)

    while heap:
        yield heapq.heappop(heap)
```

In this corrected code, the heap is initialised with the first 'k' elements and the pushpop operation is started from the (k+1)th element (at index 'k'), as it should in a k-heapsort algorithm.
----- another analysis -----
The code is almost correct but it has a minor logical/functional error. When using a heap to sort, the remaining elements in array 'arr' that the function should be pushing into the heap start at index 'k', not from index 0.

Corrected code:

```python
def kheapsort(arr, k):
    import heapq

    heap = arr[:k]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    for x in arr[k:]:
        yield heapq.heappushpop(heap, x)

    while heap:
        yield heapq.heappop(heap)
```

Explanation:
In the original version of the code, the first k elements of the array are added to the heap twice: first when the heap is initialized and again in the first loop. In the corrected code the first loop starts at index k, avoiding adding the first k elements twice.
