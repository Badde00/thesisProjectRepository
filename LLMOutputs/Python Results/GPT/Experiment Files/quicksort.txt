The provided code appears to be correct and error-free. It implements the quicksort algorithm. This algorithm essentially splits an unsorted list into a lesser array, pivot, and greater array recursively to sort the list. This code apart from the optimized one, works completely fine and doesn't seem to have any errors.

Here is an optimized version of the provided quicksort method:

```
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
```

This version optimizes pivot selection to reduce the chance of worst performance in already sorted or reverse sorted lists. It also separates values equal to the pivot into 'middle' array which are then combined directly without further sorting, further reducing unnecessary comparisons.

The written code is correct. It implements a quicksort algorithm in Python, a classical recursive method for sorting arrays. The pivot selection is the first element of the list. All elements are then divided into a 'lesser' list (elements smaller than the pivot) and a 'greater' list (elements larger than the pivot), and these lists are then sorted recursively. The good thing about the code is it handles all edge cases including an empty list.

There are no errors in the provided code. It is a correct implementation of the quicksort algorithm in Python. Works perfectly for arranging elements in ascending order.

The given Python code for the quicksort algorithm is correct. 

However one detail that could be considered as a logic issue depending on use case is that it doesn't handle duplicate values properly. If there are duplicates of the pivot value in the array, they won't be included in the lesser or greater lists, and so won't be in the final sorted array.

Here is a version that handles duplicates:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if not arr:
        return []

    pivot = arr[0]
    lesser = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot])
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    greater = quicksort([x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot])
    
    return lesser + equal + greater
```
----- another analysis -----
The provided code is correct. It implements the quicksort sorting algorithm properly by recursively selecting a "pivot" from the passed list and separates the rest of the elements into "lesser" and "greater" based on the pivot. It then concatenates the sorted lesser, pivot, and the sorted greater to get the sorted array. 

There are no syntax errors, and without additional context of use, there are no logical errors either, as it fulfills standard quicksort logic. 

However, it's worth noting that this implementation of quicksort could become inefficient for larger arrays or lists that are already sorted due to its space complexity, which is O(n^2) in the worst case.
