The code provided is meant to compute the longest common subsequence (LCS) length between two strings s and t, but it is incorrect.

Here are the problems in the code:
1. For each matching character pair, the lookup in the memoization table (dp) is incorrect. It should look at the previous character pair (i-1, j-1) instead of (i-1, j).
2. If characters don't match, then the script doesn't change the dp at (i, j), which will stay as default 0. This is also wrong since even if characters s[i] and t[j] don't match, there might be a longer LCS before i and j

Here’s the corrected version of the code:

```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import defaultdict

    dp = defaultdict(int)  # keep default value as 0

    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i, j] = max(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1])

    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
```
In this corrected code, it correctly updates dp[i,j] with either the value from the previous matching pair (i-1, j-1) or the maximum value from (i, j-1) and (i-1, j) if s[i] and t[j] don't match. This represents that we either extend the LCS ending at (i-1, j-1) or we carry over the longest sequence when advancing in either string.

Errors identified: 

1. The logic to calculate the longest common sub-sequence is incorrect.
2. The implemented logic increments the count incorrectly for matching characters.
3. The logic for updating the Counter dp upon encountering a matching character doesn't take into account the check for length of the previous longest matching sub-sequence.

Corrected version:

```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(t)
    
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)] # Initialize matrix for Dynamic Programming

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                # If the characters at the current position in both strings matches,
                # increment the dp at the current cell by adding 1 to the cell diagonally above.
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                # If the characters at the current position in both strings does not match,
                # take the max value from either the cell directly above or directly to the left.
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

    return dp[m][n] # return the bottom-right cell of the matrix
```

Explanation:
The corrected version better uses dynamic programming by making a value based on previous maximum length found. It constructs a dp table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the length of longest common sub-sequence of string till s[i-1] and t[j-1]. We fill this table in a bottom-up manner.
----- another analysis -----
There are a couple of logical errors in the code. Firstly, we can't just increment dp[i-1,j] when finding a match. We are supposed to increment dp[i-1,j-1] since it is part of an increasing subsequence. Secondly, if s[i] and t[j] are not equal, we need to compare dp[i,j-1] and dp[i-1,j] and update dp[i,j] to their maximum.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import defaultdict

    dp = defaultdict(int)

    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):
        for j in range(1, len(t)+1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i, j] = max(dp[i, j - 1], dp[i - 1, j])

    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
```

This function will correctly compute the length of the longest common subsequence of two input strings.

Note: The offsets in the indices are needed because the sequence indices start from 1 in the DP method, but Python lists are 0-indexed.

----- another analysis -----
The problems in the code are:
- The code is trying to find the longest common subsequence but the logic inside the if condition is wrong.
- It only checks for equality of characters and adds one to the previous counter which is not correct.
- dp[i-1, j] does not necessarily correspond to the correct counter. The correct counter should be dp[i-1, j-1] which is the counter right before the match.
- The Counter dictionary dp should not be used here as we only need a two-dimensional list, it's needlessly more sophisticated than needed.
- We need to handle the case where i or j are zero separately.

Corrected code:

```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    dp = [[0]*(len(t)+1) for _ in range(len(s)+1)]

    for i in range(1, len(s)+1):
        for j in range(1, len(t)+1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[-1][-1] 
```

This version finds the longest common subsequence length correctly. It starts from the beginning of both strings and checks if the characters are the same. If they are, it adds 1 to the longest length up to the previous characters in both strings. If they're not, it takes the maximum length obtained up to the previous character in either string.

----- another analysis -----
The code provided is meant to calculate the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for two input strings s and t. However, it has few logical errors resulting in incorrect outputs, explained as follows:

1. In the if block i.e `if s[i] == t[j]`, the `dp[i, j]` is being updated incorrectly. For the current pair of characters, it should consider the longest length computed so far (from the previous characters processed in both strings: `dp[i - 1, j - 1]`) and add 1 to it.
2. For the case when the characters aren't the same, the code fails to update `dp[i, j]`. In such cases, it should consider the maximum of `dp[i - 1, j]` and `dp[i, j - 1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import Counter

    dp = Counter()

    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(t)):
            if i == 0 or j == 0:
                dp[i, j] = 0
            elif s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i, j] = max(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1])

    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0
```
This would correctly return the length of the Longest Common Subsequence for the input strings.
