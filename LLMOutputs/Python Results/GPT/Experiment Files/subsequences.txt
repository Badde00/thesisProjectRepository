There are no syntax errors or exceptions thrown by the code, but there is a logical error. The functions should return [[]] when k == 0 in accordance with the mathematical definition of subsequence. Every set has exactly one 0-element subset: the empty set. If we return an empty list when k == 0, this will cause incorrect results when k == 1 because we won't be adding any empty list to the list [i] in the extend statement.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1 - k):
        ret.extend(
            [i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )

    return ret
```

The code is intended to generate all subsequences of length k from a to b (inclusive) using recursion. The main error in the given code is the base case check. Currently, the base case returns an empty list when k is 0. This causes a problem because it should actually return lists of the individual elements when k is 1 in order to generate correct subsequences. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        ret.extend(
            [[i] + rest] for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )

    return ret
```

Now, when k is equal to 0 (indicating that we have already chosen k elements), it returns a list containing an empty subsequence. For each number in the range from a to b, it extends the result list with that number appended to all subsequences of length k-1 that start from a number greater than the current number. This ensures that each subsequence is in increasing order and that all subsequences are generated.

The function seems to be working fine as it effectively generates all subsequences of length k from the given range of integers from a to b. The only thing can be improved is return statement when k==0. Instead of returning an empty list, returning a list of empty lists would be better as it helps by forming a base case where there are no more numbers to take from. Thus the correct version is:

Corrected version:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        ret.extend(
            [i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)
        )

    return ret
```

Remark: The purpose of this code is not specified. Depending on its purpose, it does not necessarily have any errors. In context, program looks like it is trying to generate all k-length subsequences of the numbers between a and b inclusive.

Potential Error:

1. If k is bigger than the number of elements, it will not return any results because the range in for loop will be empty. 

2. If k equals to 0, this doesn’t mean there are no subsequences, it means there is an empty subsequence.

3. Indentation of list comprehension’s usage within the extend method is misleading. This code does compile correctly in Python, but surrounding the list comprehension in brackets would make its interaction with the extend method more apparent.

Here is the revised version of function:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1):
            ret.append([i] + rest)

    return ret
```
----- another analysis -----
The code provided seems to be without any syntax errors and is correctly indented. However, the purpose of the code is to generate subsequences of length `k` in the range [a, b]. But since it's supposed to return all lists of length `k`, if `k` is equal to 0 it should return an empty list, rather than an empty list of lists.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def subsequences(a, b, k):
    if k == 0:
        return [[]]

    ret = []
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        ret.extend(
            [[i] + rest for rest in subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)]
        )

    return ret
```

This corrected version will return all the subsequences of length `k` in the range [a, b] where `k` is not more than the length of the range. When k is 0, this returns `[[]]` representing that there is one subsequence of length 0 i.e., the empty subsequence.
