The given code for the tower of Hanoi problem has a logical error. In the second recursive call instead of moving the disk from `helper` to `end`, the code is moving it from `start` to `helper`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))  # moving disk from start to end
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
```
----- another analysis -----
The problem is found at line #6, the order of the elements in the tuple is incorrect.
The corrected code should be:

```python
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
```

Explanation:

In the context of the Tower of Hanoi problem, each tuple represents a move from the peg indicated by the first element of the tuple to the peg indicated by the second element of the tuple. In the erroneous line #6, it should append (start, end) instead of (start, helper), indicating the disk moves directly from start to end tower.

The only error in this function is in the line where it appends the tuple (start, helper) into the steps list. It should append the tuple (start, end), so it indicates moving disk from the 'start' peg to the 'end' peg. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end)) # change this line
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
```

The function uses recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. It first moves the height-1 disks from start to helper peg, then moves the largest disk from start to end peg, and finally moves the height-1 disks from helper to end peg.
----- another analysis -----
The code logic seems to be sound but there's a minor mistake causing a bug. The function correctly implements the tower of Hanoi problem by calculating the helper tower and recursively moving rings from the start tower to the helper and the end using recursion.

The error in the code resides where the steps are being appended in the list 'steps'. The second hanoi function call should append a tuple (start, end) and not (start, helper) because start will always move a ring to the end, not the helper. 

Here is the corrected version of the program.

```
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end)) # this should be (start, end) instead of (start, helper)
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
```
----- another analysis -----
The code is almost correct except for one error in the line `steps.append((start, helper))`. According to the Tower of Hanoi problem, this should be `steps.append((start, end))` because after the initial recursive solution, the disk moved from the start position should go to the end, not the helper.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def hanoi(height, start=1, end=3):
    steps = []
    if height > 0:
        helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, start, helper))
        steps.append((start, end))
        steps.extend(hanoi(height - 1, helper, end))

    return steps
```
