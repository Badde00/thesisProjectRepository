The code is a binary search function that returns the index of 'x' in a sorted array 'arr'. There seems to be one logical error: in binary search, if the middle element is not the target value, the search proceeds to the sub-array to the left or right of the middle element.

Logical Error:

The binary search function does not take care of the scenario where 'x' is not found in 'arr' which might end up in infinite recursion because 'start' and 'end' are not updating properly. Therefore, if 'x' not found in the array, it will stuck in the loop till a recursion error.

Corrected Version of Code:

```python
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:     # Corrected (start == end) to (start > end)
            return -1
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid-1)    # Modified mid to mid-1
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid+1, end)    # Modified mid to mid+1
        else:
            return mid

    return binsearch(0, len(arr)-1)  # The end parameter should be len(arr) - 1
```

In this corrected code, the search boundaries are adjusted properly to the left or right sub-array by setting mid-1 or mid+1. And we also make sure that 'end' is set to len(arr)-1 initially, because array indexing in Python starts at zero. If the 'start' becomes more than 'end', it means 'x' is not present in 'arr' and we return -1.

There don't seem to be any syntax errors, but there's a logic error in this binary search algorithm. When `x` is not in the array, the code will go into an infinite recursion, as `binsearch(mid, end)` or `binsearch(start, mid)` are invoked without changing the arguments (`mid` is the same as `start` or `end` when `x` is not found).

To fix it, you can adjust `binsearch(start, mid)` to `binsearch(start, mid - 1)` and `binsearch(mid, end)` to `binsearch(mid + 1, end)`, Also, there should be a check for the scenario when the start index is more than the end index. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return -1
            
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid - 1)
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
        else:
            return mid

    return binsearch(0, len(arr) - 1)
```
----- another analysis -----
The provided code implements a binary search. It suffers from a problem where it can get stuck in an infinite recursion loop. This is due to the condition where the function does not properly handle the case when the search is refined to only two elements and the target is not there. In these situations, 'start' equals 'mid' and binsearch is repeatedly called with the same arguments, leading to an infinite recursion.

To fix the issue, the binary search should be updated as below: when the 'start' and 'end' variables are equal or cross each other, we return -1 indicating that the element is not found.

***Corrected Code:***

```python
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:  
            return -1
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid-1)
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid+1, end)
        else:
            return mid

    return binsearch(0, len(arr)-1)
```

In the corrected code, if the 'start' is more than the 'end', return is -1. Additionally, in the recursive calls of binsearch, 'mid-1' and 'mid+1' are used to ensure that the same value of 'start' or 'end' is not used again, hence avoiding infinite recursion. Also, 'len(arr)-1' is passed as the 'end' argument in the initial call to binsearch, since the valid indices of a Python list range from 0 to len(arr)-1.

The code provided is a recursive binary search algorithm with no visible errors. However, the function might end up running indefinitely for certain inputs due to the way mid is calculated. When there are only two elements left in the search space, the value of mid does not change because it is calculated using integer division by 2. Hence, to stop this behavior, a correction must be applied to the calculation of the mid index or the way the input is divided for the recursive calls.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if end <= start:
            return -1
        
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid)
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
        else:
            return mid
    return binsearch(0, len(arr))
```

Here, `end` is exclusive so `end <= start` will be a better condition for base case.

Furthermore, when `x > arr[mid]` condition is true, the start of the searching space should be moved to `mid + 1` instead of `mid` to avoid the situation where start and end become stagnant because of integer division (avoiding infinite recursion).
----- another analysis -----
The code in question is a binary search algorithm designed to return the index of a specified number in a sorted array. This implementation of binary search is using Python's built-in recursion. However, the code contains a logical error.

The error lies in the recursion call. If the 'x' value is not found, it will fall into an infinite recursive loop because 'start' and 'mid' or 'mid' and 'end' can become the same which causes the 'start' to always be equal to the 'end'.

We can fix this by changing the recursive call in the 'if' and 'elif' blocks to include 'mid - 1' and 'mid + 1' respectively.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
    def binsearch(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return -1
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        if x < arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(start, mid - 1)
        elif x > arr[mid]:
            return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
        else:
            return mid

    return binsearch(0, len(arr) - 1)
```

This change prevents the infinite loops by ensuring that 'start' and 'end' values are appropriately updated in each recursive call. The function now correctly returns the index of 'x' if it exists in the array, and -1 if it does not.
