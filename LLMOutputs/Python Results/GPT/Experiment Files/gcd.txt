This code is incorrect. It is intended to implement the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, but the recursive call in the else branch is incorrect. It should be `gcd(b, a % b)`, not `gcd(a % b, b)`. In the current implementation, if `b` is not 0, the division will become a kind of infinite loop and eventually resulting in a recursion error.

The corrected version of the code should be:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```

The provided code has a logical error. It's supposed to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using recursion, but because the variable `b` is not updated in the recursive procedure, the function will loop endlessly once b != 0.

The corrected version of the code:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
In the corrected version, `b` is updated with the remainder `a % b`, and `a` is replaced by `b` in each recursive step. The recursion stops when `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the gcd of the initial numbers.

There is an error in the recursive call of the function.

The recursive call should be `gcd(b, a % b)` instead of `gcd(a % b, b)`. This is how Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers works.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```

Issues:
1. Recursion in the wrong order which causes infinite loop. 

Corrected Code:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
The function computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) using the Euclidean algorithm. The corrected code ensures that the recursion properly decreases b until it reaches 0.

----- another analysis -----
The code intent seems to implement the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), but it contains a logical error. In the recursion step, it should swap the places of 'a' and 'b' in the recursive call since one of the concepts behind Euclidean algorithm is that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b).
  
Corrected version:

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
