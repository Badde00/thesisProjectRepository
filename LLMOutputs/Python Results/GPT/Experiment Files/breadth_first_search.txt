The code seems nearly correct but there is one minor logical error. When adding successors of a node to the queue and the set "nodesseen", the code should only add the successors not seen before, to prevent adding same node to queue multiple times. Here is the corrected version:

```
from collections import deque as Queue

def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.append(startnode)

    nodesseen = set()
    nodesseen.add(startnode)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()

        if node is goalnode:
            return True

        for successornode in node.successors:
            if successornode not in nodesseen:
                queue.append(successornode)
                nodesseen.add(successornode)

    return False
```

Explanation: This version of code ensures that whenever we add a node to our queue, it is a node we have not seen before. So, we do not waste time revisiting the same nodes.

The code and logic of the function look fine but it assumes that the `node` object has a `successors` property. There might be an error if the `node` object doesn't have a `successors` property.

I would change the logic to prevent the possibility of an infinite loop. In the original version of the function, if the `startnode` and the `goalnode` aren't connected, the function will run forever because it's in a `while True:` loop with no break condition that can be met. The function should return `False` once all the nodes have been visited and the `goalnode` hasn't been found. This can be done by adding a condition that breaks the loop when the queue is empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque as Queue

def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.append(startnode)

    nodesseen = set()
    nodesseen.add(startnode)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()

        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            # you must check if each successor exists in nodesseen before adding it to the queue
            for successor in node.successors:
                if successor not in nodesseen:
                    nodesseen.add(successor)
                    queue.append(successor)

    return False
```
----- another analysis -----
There does not appear to be any syntax errors in this code snippet.

However, there might be a logical issue, particularly in the way the 'seen' nodes are handled. In the current implementation, a 'successor' node is added to `nodesseen` immediately after it is discovered, without checking if it equals `goalnode`. This means that if `goalnode` is a 'successor' of a current node, and it happens to be discovered while examining that current node's successors, it will be added to `nodesseen` without having truly 'seen' or indexed it. 

A potential fix would be to wait to update 'seen' nodes until after goal-node-check has happened. This change would not affect the functionality of the code, but rather optimizes it by ensuring that the shortest path has been found, if one exists.

Corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque as Queue

def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.append(startnode)

    nodesseen = set()
    nodesseen.add(startnode)

    while True:
        node = queue.popleft()

        if node is goalnode:
            return True
        else:
            queue.extend(node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen)
            
        nodesseen.update(n for n in node.successors if n != goalnode)

    return False
```
----- another analysis -----
The code itself doesn't contain syntax errors but there is a logical error. Before a node's successors are added to the queue, they have to be added to the nodesseen set to prevent processing the same node multiple times which can cause an infinite loop if the graph has cycles. 

Corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque as Queue

def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue()
    queue.append(startnode)

    nodesseen = set()
    nodesseen.add(startnode)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()

        if node is goalnode:
            return True

        successors = [node for node in node.successors if node not in nodesseen]
        nodesseen.update(successors)
        queue.extend(successors)

    return False
```

The code is satisfactory and doesn't contain any explicit errors. But it may cause problems if the "successors" attribute isn't defined within the nodes provided. It's an implementation dependent code, which expects a `node` object that has a `successors` attribute or method to obtain the children or adjacent nodes. Also, it's assumed that the nodes used have a proper `__eq__` and `__hash__` method implemented so that they can be added to the `nodesseen` set and be compared in `if node is goalnode:`. 

Also, the code doesn't provide a way to find out the path from startnode to the goalnode. It merely returns a boolean to indicate whether or not a goalnode is reachable from the startnode.  

If you want to return the path from startnode to goalnode as well, consider modifying your code as given below:

```python
from collections import deque as Queue

def breadth_first_search(startnode, goalnode):
    queue = Queue([(startnode, [startnode])])
    nodesseen = set([startnode])

    while queue:
        (node, path) = queue.popleft()

        if node == goalnode:
            return path

        for next_node in node.successors - nodesseen:
            queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))
            nodesseen.add(next_node)

    return None
```
This modified function will return a list containing the nodes from startnode to goalnode indicating the path it took to reach the goalnode. If no path exists, it returns None.
