The code given is correct and there's no error in it. The function 'to_base' is used to convert any number into different numeric bases from 2 to 36. It used the 'string' library to utilize digits and uppercase letters as an alphabet for non-decimal numeric bases. The 'while' loop is correctly converting the number into the given numeric base and there's no error in the logic applied. All variables and functions are properly defined and used.

The code is correct, but the output will be in reversed order because each new digit is appended to the end. 

Here is a slightly modified version of the code that reverses the result before returning: 

```python
import string
def to_base(num, b):
    result = ''
    alphabet = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase
    while num > 0:
        i = num % b
        num = num // b
        result = alphabet[i] + result
    return result
```

Now, each new digit is appended at the beginning. As a result, the least significant digit will be at the end of the final string, which is the usual way of representing numbers.

The code has no syntax and logical errors. However, there's a minor issue. When a number is converted to some base, the least significant digit (LSD - modulus) should be appended at the end of the result. The current code prepends the LSD at the start which messes up the order. The corrected version is below: 

```python
import string
def to_base(num, b):
    result = ''
    alphabet = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase
    while num > 0:
        i = num % b
        num = num // b
        result = alphabet[i] + result  # append the remainder at the end
    return result
```

In the updated version, instead of adding the latest calculated symbol to the end of the result string, we add it to the beginning. This way, the result string is in the correct order without requiring a potentially expensive string reversal operation.
----- another analysis -----
The given code seems to be correct with no errors. It is used to convert a number into base `b` with 'b' having a maximum possible value of 36, due to alphabet being created from digits and ascii uppercase letters. It starts by dividing the `num` by `b`, appending the remainder (which is indeed the base `b` representation of `num`) to `result`, then continues to perform the operation on the quotient until `num` is 0. However, it should be noted that this code will work only for non-negative integers and bases 2-36.
----- another analysis -----
The code given is logically correct but the result is in reverse order. It's converting a decimal number to a base b number using digits and uppercase alphabets. After calculating the remainder, it is added to the front of the result, not the end - so we need to reverse the final result before returning.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import string
def to_base(num, b):
    result = ''
    alphabet = string.digits + string.ascii_uppercase
    while num > 0:
        i = num % b
        num = num // b
        result = alphabet[i] + result
    return result
```
