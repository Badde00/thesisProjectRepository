This code theoretically looks fine, but it contains efficiency issues that could potentially lead to errors. 

1. The usage of `set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes)` in the loop is inefficient because it creates a new set from the list `ordered_nodes` in every iteration. Creating the set once before the loop would improve efficiency.

2. The check `if not node.incoming_nodes` is unreliable to determine if there are no incoming nodes because it depends on the implementation of 'incoming_nodes', which can be None or an empty container (list, set, etc.).

3. The usage of `nextnode not in ordered_nodes` to check the presence of `nextnode` in `ordered_nodes` is inefficient. A better approach would be to maintain a separate set to keep track of nodes in `ordered_nodes`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    ordered_nodes_set = set(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if all(n in ordered_nodes_set for n in nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes_set:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                ordered_nodes_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes
```

In this corrected code, we've created `ordered_nodes_set` to efficiently check the presence of a node in `ordered_nodes`. We've also used the `all()` function to ensure that all `incoming_nodes` are present in `ordered_nodes_set`.

1. The overall logic of the topological ordering function is correct, but there are performance issues. The problematic part is `if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes)` inside the double `for` loop of the function. This code translates each `ordered_nodes` list into a set within a loop which makes it costly and unnecessary in terms of time and space complexity. We could transform the `ordered_nodes` list into a set before entering the loop to avoid doing this each time we iterate through.

Here is the corrected script:

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    ordered_set = set(ordered_nodes) # convert ordered_nodes to set before the loop

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if ordered_set.issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_set:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                ordered_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes
```
2. The "append" call in the last part of the code may skip some nodes unintentionally. This is not a deterministic error but can cause issues in specific scenarios. Therefore, sometimes we may need to use a different algorithm for implementing topological sort, such as DFS (Depth-First Search), Karn's algorithm, etc.

This provided code assumes that `node.incoming_nodes` and `node.outgoing_nodes` are always exist and well-defined, which is not well-handled here but depends on the data passed to the function. Please consider these points while using this code in a practical application. Ensure your `node` objects are well-prepared with `incoming_nodes` and `outgoing_nodes` attributes.

1. Creating a new set in every iteration is a performance overhead:
```
if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes)
```

2. The usage of list for 'ordered_nodes' is not efficient when checking if a node is present in it. This has a time complexity of O(n) for each element. A set would be better in terms of efficiency. 

Corrected version: 

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    ordered_nodes_set = set(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if ordered_nodes_set.issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes_set:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                ordered_nodes_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes
```
In this corrected version, 'ordered_nodes_set' is a set that mirrors 'ordered_nodes'. The set is used for membership existence because in a set it checks in constant O(1) time. The list 'ordered_nodes' is kept, as we return a list and we want to keep the order of insertion.
----- another analysis -----
The current code does not contain any syntax errors but the logic implemented in the code is incorrect for producing a topological order of a graph. The current implementation checks for no incoming nodes for initial insertion into the ordered_nodes list, and then casually adds nodes into the ordered_nodes list without regard to correct topological ordering.

One of the common algorithm for topological sorting involves performing depth-first search on the graph and pushing the nodes onto a stack in post-order, and then reversing the stack to get a topological ordering. Here's an example of how to implement this:

```python
def dfs(node, visited, stack):
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbour in node.outgoing_nodes:
        if neighbour not in visited:
            dfs(neighbour, visited, stack)
    stack.append(node)

def topological_ordering(nodes):
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    for node in nodes:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node, visited, stack)
    stack.reverse()  # Reverse the stack to get the topological ordering.
    return stack
```
This problem assumes that the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). For non-DAGs, topological ordering is not possible. 

Also note that the nodes have properties `node.outgoing_nodes`  in your code, but the provided python objects may not have those properties. This is beyond the scope of this problem, but keep in mind that you may need to adjust the methodology depending on the way the graph is implemented in your use case.
----- another analysis -----
There seems to be no clear logic error in the code, but there's a potential performance issue: the code turns `ordered_nodes` into a set inside the for loop. This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which could slow down the program if `nodes` has a large length.

A better approach is to convert `ordered_nodes` to a set before entering the for loop.

'''python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    ordered_nodes_set = set(ordered_nodes)

    for node in ordered_nodes:
        for nextnode in node.outgoing_nodes:
            if ordered_nodes_set.issuperset(nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes_set:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
                ordered_nodes_set.add(nextnode)

    return ordered_nodes
'''

Note: This code assumes that `node.incoming_nodes` and `node.outgoing_nodes` are list of nodes. Furthermore, it assumes that the provided `nodes` list does not contain duplicates and that the network of nodes contains no cycles. For a real application, these factors would need to be taken into account.
