The given code appears to be correct, without any obvious syntax, runtime, or logical errors. 

This is a binary search algorithm and it is intended to find the first occurrence of an element in a sorted list. The 'arr' variable is the list, and 'x' is the element to find. When the element is not found, the function returns -1. 

However, the algorithm has a potential infinite loop in specific cases where 'x' is smaller than the smallest element in the array. The 'hi' is set to 'mid' when 'x' is less than or equal to 'arr[mid]' and 'mid' always rounds down when taking 'lo' and 'hi's' average. So if 'x' is less than the smallest element in list, then the 'hi' doesn't change hence it results in infinite loop. 

Here is the corrected version, changing 'hi = mid' to 'hi = mid - 1':

```python
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1

    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid

        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1
```

The given code is a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a number x in the sorted list arr. It generally works but, unfortunately, it falls into infinite loop in situations when the condition x <= arr[mid] is met, but the number searched for, x, is not in the array. That's because the mid index stays the same in the next cycle.

To fix the issue, we can change the calculation of "hi" value. Instead of setting it to mid, we can set it to mid - 1 to ensure the boundaries of search will reduce with each step, and thus guaranteeing eventual termination of the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1

    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid

        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1
```

The given code is technically correct syntactically and logically; however, it can go into an infinite loop in some scenarios. 

The issue could occur when the input 'x' is less than or equal to the 'mid' element in the array, because 'mid' value is assigned to 'hi'. If 'mid' is 0, then 'hi' would remain 0 in subsequent loops. To avoid this infinite loop, decrement 'hi' by 1 in the 'elif' condition block.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1

    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid] and (mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]):
            return mid

        elif x <= arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1
```

In this corrected code, 'hi' is set to len(arr)-1 to get the last index of the array. The condition in the 'while' loop is also corrected to lo <= hi to include the scenario when 'lo' and 'hi' are equal.

The given code seems correct. It's a binary search algorithm for a sorted array to find the first occurrence of an element. The function `find_first_in_sorted(arr, x)` is designed to find the first occurrence of `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The requirement to keep this code working correctly is, the `arr` must be sorted in non-decreasing order. This code conducts a binary search over the array and will return the index of the first occurrence of `x` or will return -1 if `x` cannot be found in the array. 

One additional note we can make is binary search can cause stack overflow in certain languages like Java, C, C++ for very large arrays and large values of 'key' as the middle element is calculated as (low + high)/2. Though this is not an issue with this Python code, it's good to know as it's an issue with the algorithm itself rather than the implementation.

So, there are no changes required in the code and seems perfectly fine. Please test it in different scenarios to fully ensure the integrity of the code.

The code has a logical error where it could end up in an infinite loop. If "x" is present at the middle of "arr" (arr[mid] == x), but it is not the first occurrence (x == arr[mid -1]), the loop will continue without changing the value of "lo" or "hi". This will cause the loop to stagnate, as "mid" will not change, and the loop will continue infinitely. 

To fix this, we need to make sure that "hi" or "lo" are always updated during the loop. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_first_in_sorted(arr, x):
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr)

    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2

        if x == arr[mid]:
            if mid == 0 or x != arr[mid - 1]:
                return mid
            else:
                hi = mid

        elif x < arr[mid]:
            hi = mid

        else:
            lo = mid + 1

    return -1
```
In this corrected version, the logic of finding the first occurrence is separated from the comparison of the middle element "arr[mid]" with "x". This ensures that the "hi" variable is updated even if the first occurrence has not yet been found.
