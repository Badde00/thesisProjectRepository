The function is written correctly. However, there is a logical error in the above code. The function is supposed to find the 'kth' smallest element in the list. But, if the list 'arr' contains duplicate elements, then it will lead to an infinite recursive call. 

To fix this, we need to handle the pivot elements differently, making sure the pivot covers equal numbers when counting towards k. 

Please find the corrected code below:

```
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    pivot_count = arr.count(pivot)
  
    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = num_less + pivot_count

    if k < num_less:
        # kth element is in 'below' list
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        # kth element is in 'above' list 
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        # pivot value is the kth element
        return pivot
```

In this code, the variable 'pivot_count' is used to account for the number of values equal to the 'pivot' in the array 'arr'. This change ensures that the program doesn't get stuck in a loop when 'arr' contains duplicate values. 'num_lessoreq' is then calculated by adding 'num_less' and 'pivot_count' to ensure that it accounts for all elements less than or equal to pivot.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code doesn't have any syntax errors. However, it might cause an index error in some situations because it doesn't check if 'k' is within the valid range of input array 'arr'. 

If 'k' is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of 'arr', the function should return an error or None to prevent undefined behavior. 

The code also doesn't account for duplicates in the list. With the current method, a list with duplicates would not yield the correct result. 

Here's a possible correction to handle these issues:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    if k < 0 or k >= len(arr):
        return None

    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_equal = len(equal)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k < num_less + num_equal:
        return pivot
    else:
        return kth(above, k - num_less - num_equal)
```

This amended function now correctly handles lists with duplicate values and returns None when 'k' is outside of the valid range. This function utilizes the concept of Quickselect, a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list. It is related to the quicksort sorting algorithm.
----- another analysis -----
The code is meant to find the k-th smallest number in an array by using the QuickSelect algorithm. There are no syntax errors.

The algorithm is generally correct but it doesn't handle the case where there are duplicates in the array. All the duplicates will be missed out by the algorithm except the pivot.

A logical improvement would be to separate a list for equal numbers:

Corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    equal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(below) + len(equal)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

This handles the case where there are duplicate entries in the array. Any number equal to the pivot are placed in the 'equal' array. When 'k' falls in the range of the 'equal' array, the pivot is returned.
----- another analysis -----
The provided Python code tries to find the kth smallest number in a given list. But, there are some possible bugs in it, especially under some border conditions:

1. If there are duplicate numbers in the array, especially the same as the pivot, they will be eliminated in the recursion since they are not included in neither `below` nor `above` lists. This may cause problems when k is larger than the length of the processed elements.

2. If the smallest or largest number in the array is chosen as the pivot, it will cause stack overflow due to the infinitely recursive calls.

The corrected code would appear like this:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    iequals = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(below) + len(iequals)

    if k < num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k >= num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

In this version of the code, a new list called `iequals` has been introduced. The `iequals` list includes values that are equal to the pivot. The length of the `below` and `iequals` list combined gives us the correct number of elements in the array that are less than or equal to the pivot. The corrected code effectively handles the kth smallest element when there are duplicate elements in the array.
----- another analysis -----
The code seems to be a function to find the kth smallest element in an array. If there must be any error, it could be on function parameters/input during function call.
* If array `arr` is empty, it would invoke a `list index out of range` error. There should be a check if the array is empty.
* If `k` is greater than the length of the array or less than 1, it would return incorrect results.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def kth(arr, k):
    if not arr: # check if array is empty
        return None
    if k < 1 or k > len(arr): # check if k is valid
        return None

    pivot = arr[0]
    below = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    above = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

    num_less = len(below)
    num_lessoreq = len(arr) - len(above)

    if k <= num_less:
        return kth(below, k)
    elif k > num_lessoreq:
        return kth(above, k - num_lessoreq)
    else:
        return pivot
```

Note that:
- The `if k < num_less:` has been changed to `if k <= num_less:` and `elif k >= num_lessoreq:` to `elif k > num_lessoreq:` because in Python, indices start from 0 but in the case of kth smallest element k starts from 1.
