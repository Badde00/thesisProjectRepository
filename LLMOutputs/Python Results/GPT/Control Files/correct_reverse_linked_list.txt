The provided code appears to be correct, assuming the linked list is implemented such that each node has a property "successor" which points to the next node in the list.

The function `reverse_linked_list(node)` takes the head of a linked list as an argument and reverses the order of the nodes in the list in-place, returning the new head of the list (i.e. the original tail).

If `node.successor` is not the correct field for the next node in the linked list for the particular implementation being used, the field should be updated accordingly. Other than that, no errors seem immediately apparent.

The code seems fine, assuming this is a singly linked list where each node has an attribute 'successor' referring to the next node. And what it is doing is reversing a linked list starting from 'node'. 

But without knowledge of the Node class structure or the language this being written for, it's hard to give a correct analysis. For instance, "successor" is an unusual name for referencing the next node in a linked list--a conventionally used name is 'next'. 

If 'successor' is not pre-defined, the code may throw an attribute error. 

Here is a typical Python-based linked list node structure modification of the function:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.next
        node.next = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
```

The function now reverses a linked list using ListNode class where 'next' is defined.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code appears to be alright given that it's part of Python code intended to reverse a linked list. However, the node structure has not been defined in the problem and itâ€™s presumed that the node has an attribute called 'successor' which represents the next node in the linked list.

If there is any error, it might be associated with the nodes' structure itself. Rather than 'successor', linked lists generally use 'next' to refer to the next node.

Here's a corrected version provided that 'next' is the correct attribute:

```python
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prev_node = None
    while node:
        next_node = node.next
        node.next = prev_node
        prev_node = node
        node = next_node
    return prev_node
```

Again, if there are errors, this might need adjustments to align with the node structure. Without additional details about the linked list structure, it's challenging to specify exact errors.
----- another analysis -----
This code doesn't seem to have any errors, as long as it's used in a context where a linked list has been created and nodes have a 'successor' attribute to signify their following node.

Please be aware that linked list node's 'next' node conventionally is referred as 'next' not 'successor' in many languages. So typically the code would look like this:

```python
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prev_node = None
    while node:
        next_node = node.next
        node.next = prev_node
        prev_node = node
        node = next_node
    return prev_node
```

Make sure to replace 'next' or 'successor' to the appropriate attribute that is used in your linked list data structure.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code is correct to reverse a linked list considering some presumptions about the linked list class. This code considers the following points:
- Each node of the linked list contains an attribute "successor" pointing to the next node. It is common to use the name "next" instead of "successor.
- The class definitions for linked list nodes aren't available, which is fine if they are defined elsewhere in your code.
- This code does not handle edge cases such as whether the head of the linked list is None (i.e., the list is empty). This is also not necessarily an error, but a point to consider depending on your use case.

Here is the same function with improved naming for clarity:

```
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prev_node = None
    while node:
        next_node = node.next
        node.next = prev_node
        prev_node = node
        node = next_node
    return prev_node
```

Remember to ensure that your linked list Node class is actually defined with 'next' or 'successor'. Here is an example of a linked list Node class:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```
