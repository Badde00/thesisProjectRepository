The code has logical error which leads to infinite loop. In the binary search algorithm, if we find that x <= arr[mid], we should set hi = mid - 1, not hi = mid. Similarly, in the else loop, we should set lo = mid + 1. 

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            
            if(x > arr[mid]){
                lo = mid + 1;
            }else if(x < arr[mid] || (mid > 0 && arr[mid-1] == x)){
                hi = mid - 1;
            }else{
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

}
```
Explanations:
This Java code runs a binary search in a given sorted list (arr). It checks for the existence of the integer (x) in the list and
returns the index of the first occurrence of 'x' when it is found. If 'x' isn't found in the list, the function returns -1.

The adjustments made fixed the issue where the algorithm would potentially enter an infinite loop because the high range (hi) was set to arr.length and not arr.length - 1. Additionally, conditions were adjusted so the high and low range would properly close in on the integer being sought.
----- another analysis -----
The original code has an infinite loop because in the condition `if (x <= arr[mid])`, it is assigning `hi` to `mid` which may not change `mid` on the next iteration if `x` is still less than or equal to `arr[mid]`. Same problem appears on assigning `hi = mid`. 

This can be fixed by assigning `hi = mid - 1` when `x <= arr[mid]` and `lo = mid + 1` respectively to ensure that the range `[lo, hi]` being considered always shrinks and avoids the infinite loop situation. Additionally, `hi = arr.length;` should be changed to `hi = arr.length - 1;` to avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Correct code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {
    
    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;
    
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (x <= arr[mid]) {
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
----- another analysis -----
The given code contains an error which might lead to an infinite loop. When the 'x' value is less than or equal to 'arr[mid]', the 'hi = mid;' code will not change the 'mid' value if 'hi - lo = 1'. This will result in a repeated mid value in the next iteration of the 'while' loop leading to an infinite loop.

The corrected code is as below:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (x <= arr[mid]) {
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

}
```
In this corrected code, I changed the 'hi' initialization to 'arr.length - 1' since array indices start at 0. For calculating 'mid', instead of directly averaging 'lo' and 'hi', I applied the formula 'lo + (hi-lo)/2' to avoid overflow errors. When 'x <= arr[mid]', 'hi' is set to 'mid - 1', not 'mid'.
----- another analysis -----
The code has only one minor error which can lead to an infinite loop. The reason behind this is that the value of `hi` should be decreased by 1 when updating, otherwise the while loop will not exit as expected when `lo` equals `hi`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
               return mid;
            } else if (x <= arr[mid]) {
               hi = mid - 1;   // decrement hi 
            } else {
               lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

}
```
When the new high part (`hi`) is set to the middle element in binary sort, it should be set as `mid - 1` instead of `mid`, to avoid the possibility of an infinite loop. In addition, it's better to set `hi = arr.length - 1` instead of `hi = arr.length`, as it avoids the potential IndexOutOfBoundsException.
----- another analysis -----
There is one logical error in the code causing an infinite loop. It happens when the `x` value is less than or equal to `arr[mid]`. In that case, `hi` should be set to `mid - 1` instead of `mid` to avoid an infinite loop.

Below is the corrected code.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length - 1;  // here

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;

            if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (x <= arr[mid]) {
                hi = mid - 1;  // and here
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

}
```
