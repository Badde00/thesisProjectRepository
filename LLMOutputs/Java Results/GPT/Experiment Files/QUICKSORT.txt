The provided code actually doesn't contain any errors and implements the QuickSort algorithm correctly in Java. This algorithm is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. 

It works by using a pivot point and partitioning the remaining elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sorting process then proceeds recursively until the entire list is sorted. 

Here, the first element of each sub-array is chosen as the pivot. This is a common, but not universal, choice. Different pivot selection methods can result in different algorithmic performance.

The code is correct and will correctly perform the quicksort algorithm in Java. Quicksort is a “divide and conquer” algorithm, and this code follows that logic. It takes an array, selects a pivot and then creates two lists, one of numbers less than the pivot and one of numbers greater than the pivot, then it recursively sorts those lists and finally concatenates the sorted lists to return a sorted array.

The given Java code is correct and doesn't have any syntax or logical errors. 

This program implements the QuickSort algorithm, which is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The pivot chosen here is always the first element of the array (arr.get(0)).

The syntax is correct. The comparison operators are used correctly and the use of ArrayList's and their methods are correct as well. The recursion in the quicksort function is correct. Elements less than pivot are added to 'lesser' ArrayList, elements greater than pivot are added to 'greater' ArrayList. The pivot is added to 'middle' ArrayList. Then, 'lesser' ArrayList is sorted, 'greater' ArrayList is also sorted. After that elements from 'greater' ArrayList are added to 'middle' ArrayList and then elements from 'middle'ArrayList are added to 'lesser' ArrayList and it is returned.

The code provided is a Java implementation of the quicksort algorithm and is functionally correct. The quicksort algorithm works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

There's no errors in the provided code.

For improvements, the classes and methods in java can be declared with PascalCase and camelCase respectively, following best practice.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class QuickSort {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> quickSort(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {
        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            return new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }

        Integer pivot = arr.get(0);
        ArrayList<Integer> lesser = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        ArrayList<Integer> greater = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for (Integer x : arr.subList(1, arr.size())) {
            if (x < pivot) {
                lesser.add(x);
            } else if (x > pivot) {
                greater.add(x);
            }
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> middle = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        middle.add(pivot);
        lesser = quickSort(lesser);
        greater = quickSort(greater);
        middle.addAll(greater);
        lesser.addAll(middle);
        return lesser;
    }
}
```

This code is a simple implementation of QuickSort in Java. It does not have any errors. The QuickSort algorithm works by choosing a pivot and then separating the remaining elements into two lists, one for elements less than the pivot and one for elements greater than the pivot. These lists are then recursively sorted in the same manner, and the results are joined together.

Therefore, there is no need to edit the code. Beautifully written!
