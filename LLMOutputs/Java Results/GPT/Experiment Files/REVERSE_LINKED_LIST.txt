The provided Java code may not have a compile-time error, but its functionality relies on a hypothetical Node class that should contain 'getSuccessor()' and 'setSuccessor(Node node)' methods, which are methods generally not present in a standard linked list node implementation. 

It's also worth noting that even though this method is part of a class, it does not access any instance data or methods, so it could very well be declared as a static method.

Here is the corrected version with assuming that Node class has 'next' property and no 'getSuccessor()' and 'setSuccessor(Node node)' methods:

```java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        next = null;
    }
}

public class ReverseLinkedList {

    public static Node reverseLinkedList(Node node) {
        Node prevNode = null;
        Node currentNode = node;
        Node nextNode;

        while (currentNode != null) {
            nextNode = currentNode.next;
            currentNode.next = prevNode;
            prevNode = currentNode;
            currentNode = nextNode;
        }

        return prevNode;
    }
}
``` 

In this corrected version, I provided an example of how a Node class is typically constructed for a Linked List. I also renamed the reverseLinkedList method according to Java naming conventions (camelCase).

Yes, there is an error in the above code.

The error is that the prevnode variable is not being updated in each iteration of the while loop. This causes the final returned "reversed" linked list to not be reversed correctly, missing nodes from the input linked list.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class REVERSE_LINKED_LIST {
    public static Node reverse_linked_list(Node node) {
        Node prevnode = null;
        Node nextnode;
        while (node != null) {
            nextnode = node.getSuccessor();
            node.setSuccessor(prevnode);
            prevnode = node;
            node = nextnode;
        }
        return prevnode;
    }
}
```
The above code first stores the reference to the next node, then changes the next of the current node to the previous node and moves the previous node and current node one step forward. This happens until the entire list is reversed. 

As a standard practice, it is recommended to use camelCase for naming variables and methods in Java for better readability. You can consider to replace `reverse_linked_list` with `reverseLinkedList`, and other variable names like `prevnode`, `nextnode` respectively.
----- another analysis -----
The code provided uses a Node object without defining it. The code should also adhere to the Java naming conventions, where class names should be in PascalCase and method names should be in camelCase. Here is a corrected version of the code assuming the Node definition.

```java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        next = null;
    }

    public void setData(int data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public int getData() {
        return data;
    }

    public void setNext(Node node) {
        next = node;
    }

    public Node getNext() {
        return next;
    }
}

public class ReverseLinkedList {
    public static Node reverseLinkedList(Node node) {
        Node prevNode = null;
        Node nextNode;
        while (node != null) {
            nextNode = node.getNext();
            node.setNext(prevNode);
            prevNode = node;
            node = nextNode;
        }
        return prevNode;
    }
}
```

The code now correctly creates a Node class before using it in ReverseLinkedList. It includes getter and setter methods for both the 'data' and 'next' instance variables. The reverseLinkedList method now properly references these instance variables of Node using the provided methods. The 'prevnode' is set to the current 'node' before progressing, which was previously missing. The class and method names have been updated to follow Java naming conventions.
----- another analysis -----
The code posted has no syntax errors, but the functional correctness depends on the implementation of Node class which is not provided here. Assuming a standard Node class structure where getSuccessor() method returns the next node in the list and setSuccessor(Node node) sets the next node to the passed node, the code would work to reverse a linked list. 

However, the code is missing the step to update 'prevnode'. The correct version should be:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class REVERSE_LINKED_LIST {
    public static Node reverse_linked_list(Node node) {
        Node prevnode = null;
        Node nextnode;
        while (node != null) {
            nextnode = node.getSuccessor();
            node.setSuccessor(prevnode);
            prevnode = node;        // Adding line to update prevnode  
            node = nextnode;
        }
        return prevnode;
    }
}
```

Without updating 'prevnode', the method would not correctly reverse the linked list as it would lose the reference to the previous node as we traverse the list.
----- another analysis -----
The code looks fine but there are some unknown methods and classes which are not declared in the code (not necessarily an error if they're defined elsewhere). However, without knowing their implementations, it's impossible to definitively identify errors based on this code alone. 

The "Node" class and "getSuccessor" and "setSuccessor" methods used in the code are not given. These parts will cause compile-time errors if they aren't defined elsewhere in the codebase.

For instance, let's assume the Node class is something like this:

```java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        next = null;
    }
}
```

If so, the corrected code could be:

```java
public class REVERSE_LINKED_LIST {
    public static Node reverse_linked_list(Node node) {
        Node prevNode = null;
        Node nextNode;
        while (node != null) {
            nextNode = node.next;
            node.next = prevNode;
            prevNode = node;
            node = nextNode;
        }
        return prevNode;
    }
}
```

This would actually reverse a singly-linked list in Java, whereby the 'next' of each node is changed to its previous node and the 'next' of the first node is null. The last node then becomes the first node of the reversed list.
