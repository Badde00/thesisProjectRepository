There are no logical or syntactical errors in the given Java code. The given function "to_base" converts a number to a specified base. 

However, from the perspective of coding best practices, appending a string inside a loop using the "+" operation can be inefficient in Java, due to the way strings are implemented (they are immutable, meaning every addition creates a new string). StringBuilder is often recommended in such cases.

Therefore, the code can be optimized as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TO_BASE {
    public static String to_base(int num, int b) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int i;
        while (num > 0) {
            i = num % b;
            num = num / b;
            result.append(alphabet.charAt(i));
        }

        return result.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

Also please notice that the converted number string should be reversed to get the correct answer because the remainder of the first division should be at the end of the result.

This java code is mostly correct. But it will give you the reversed output. After conversion from a number to a specified base, the resultant string should be reversed. Also, the class and method names should be in CamelCase as per Java naming conventions. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ToBase {
    public static String toBase(int num, int b) {
        String result = "";
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        while (num > 0) {
            int i = num % b;
            num = num / b;
            result = alphabet.charAt(i) + result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Explanation:

Included the missing step of reversing the result. And changed class name and method name to match Java naming conventions. I also moved int i inside the while loop as it's not being used outside it.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code works properly, but it produces a string that is in reverse order because of the algorithm used to convert to a particular base. Besides that, if the base is more significant than 36, the method would fail because only 36 characters are used for base encoding.

Here's the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TO_BASE {
    public static String to_base(int num, int b) {
        if (b < 2 || (b > 36)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Base must be between 2 and 36");
        }
        
        String result = "";
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int i;
        while (num > 0) {
            i = num % b;
            num = num / b;
            result = alphabet.charAt(i) + result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
In the corrected code:

1. I added a test to ensure that the base is between 2 and 36.
2. When adding the characters found from the alphabet to the result, I prepended them to the start of the string rather than appending to the end. So the output is in the correct order. 

Please note iterative approaches will give us the result in reversed order. So this problem could be resolved by either sticking to recursion or reversing the returned string.
----- another analysis -----
The logic in the code is correct but the returned base string will be reversed. For example, if you convert number 10 to base 2, it should return "1010" but in this case, it would return "0101". You can fix this by reversing the result before returning.

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TO_BASE {
    public static String to_base(int num, int b) {
        String result = "";
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int i;
        while (num > 0) {
            i = num % b;
            num = num / b;
            result = String.valueOf(alphabet.charAt(i)) + result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

In this corrected version, rather than appending the newly converted character to the end of the string, it is added at the beginning which effectively reverses the string allowing the sequence to be correct.
----- another analysis -----
The existing code has no syntax errors, but it does have a logical error. The resulting number would be reversed, as the remainder of the operation would be added to the result string at each step. To correct this, we should reverse the string before returning it.
Applying this fix, the correct code would look like this:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TO_BASE {
    public static String to_base(int num, int b) {
        String result = "";
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int i;
        while (num > 0) {
            i = num % b;
            num = num / b;
            result = String.valueOf(alphabet.charAt(i)) + result;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
I have switched the order of addition when assigning the new calculated character to result to achieve this.

Or if you maintain the original version, you may add `Collections.reverse` before returning:

```java
return new StringBuilder(result).reverse().toString();
```
