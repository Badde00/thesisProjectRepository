The provided code does not handle negative numbers in the array properly. In the current code, if max_ending_here becomes negative, it will simply be set to zero, this is incorrect. We should start a new sub-array when it goes negative. Also, there's no main method for the execution.


Here is a corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MAX_SUBLIST_SUM {

    public static int max_sublist_sum(int[] arr) {
        int max_ending_here = arr[0];
        int max_so_far = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max_ending_here = Math.max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i]);
            max_so_far = Math.max(max_so_far, max_ending_here);
        }
        
        return max_so_far;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3};
        System.out.println("Maximum contiguous sum is " + max_sublist_sum(arr));
    }
}
```
This code uses the Kadane's algorithm which will correctly calculate the maximum sublist sum even if the input list contains negative numbers. And added a main method for execution with sample input.
----- another analysis -----
The code doesn't handle arrays that include only negative numbers correctly. If the array only has negative numbers, max_sublist_sum will return 0, which may not be the expected behavior. 

We should include a condition to check if the max_ending_here becomes less than zero, then reset it back to zero.

In case all numbers are negative the max_sublist_sum should be initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MAX_SUBLIST_SUM {
    public static int max_sublist_sum(int[] arr) {
        int max_ending_here = 0;
        int max_so_far = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int x : arr) {
            max_ending_here = max_ending_here + x;

            // update max_so_far 
            if (max_so_far < max_ending_here)
                max_so_far = max_ending_here;

            // reset max_ending_here to 0 if it becomes negative
            if (max_ending_here < 0)
                max_ending_here = 0;
        }

        return max_so_far;
    }
}
```
This way we ensure that we find the maximum possible sublist sum, even if the entire array consists of negative numbers.
----- another analysis -----
The code provided is almost correct, but it fails in case all elements in the array are negative. The function will incorrectly return 0 instead of the maximum negative number.


Here's the corrected version of your code with proper handling of negative numbers:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MAX_SUBLIST_SUM{
    public static int max_sublist_sum(int[] arr) {
        int max_ending_here = arr[0];
        int max_so_far = arr[0];

        for(int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
            max_ending_here = Math.max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i]);
            max_so_far = Math.max(max_so_far, max_ending_here);
        }

        return max_so_far;
    }
}
```

In this corrected version, max_ending_here and max_so_far are both initialized with the value of the first element in the array. For each next element in the array, maximum between this element and the sum of this element and max_ending_here is taken as the new max_ending_here. Then, max_so_far is updated as the maximum between max_so_far and max_ending_here. This way, the function correctly handles a case when all elements in the array are negative.
----- another analysis -----
The code appears to be implementing the Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum. However, it has a mistake: it does not handle the case when all the numbers in the array are negative. 

In its current state, the function would always return 0 for an array with all negative values, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to return the largest negative number in such cases.

Here is a corrected version of the method:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MAX_SUBLIST_SUM {
    public static int max_sublist_sum(int[] arr) {
        int max_ending_here = arr[0];     // initialize with the first element
        int max_so_far = arr[0];          // initialize with the first element
        
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {   // start from the second element
            max_ending_here = Math.max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i]);
            max_so_far = Math.max(max_so_far, max_ending_here);
        }

        return max_so_far;
    }
}
```
The initialization for max_ending_here and max_so_far have been set to arr[0] and a loop is started from the second element of the array. This will handle the case where all the numbers in the array are negative.
----- another analysis -----
The provided Java code is using the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sublist sum within an array. However, the algorithm doesn't account for arrays that only contain negative numbers. In the case where all numbers are negative, the code will still return 0 as the maximum sublist sum, which is incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the code that accounts for the situation where the array only consists of negative numbers:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MAX_SUBLIST_SUM {
    public static int max_sublist_sum(int[] arr) {
        int max_ending_here = arr[0];
        int max_so_far = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max_ending_here = Math.max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i]);
            max_so_far = Math.max(max_so_far, max_ending_here);
        }

        return max_so_far;
    }
}
```
In this version, `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` are initialized with the value of the first element of the array. This will hold the correct result in the case of all negative numbers. The loop also starts from the index 1 instead of 0, as the first element is already considered in the initialisations.
