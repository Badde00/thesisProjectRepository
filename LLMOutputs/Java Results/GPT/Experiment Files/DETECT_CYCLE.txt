The above code has logic errors in it. Here are the two types of errors that are present:

1. The hare pointer might throw a NullPointerException if it points to null, because the "while" loop continues infinitely.
2. There is no guarantee that the hare (fast pointer) will ever meet the tortoise (slow pointer) if there is no cycle. But the condition to stop the loop is only on equalizing the hare and tortoise and when the hare doesn't have a successor. In case of a non-cyclical linked list, this would lead to an infinite loop.

The corrected code is as follows:

```
import java.util.*;

public class DETECT_CYCLE {
    public static boolean detect_cycle(Node node) {
        if(node == null) 
            return false; // if list is empty, then no cycle can exist

        Node hare = node;
        Node tortoise = node;

        while (hare != null && hare.getSuccessor() != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.getSuccessor();
            hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor();

            if (hare == tortoise)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the issue by checking whether both "hare" and its successor (hare.getSuccessor()) are not null. This fixes the loop in the case of a non-cyclical linked list and avoids NullPointerException when hare points to null. Also, added a condition to check if the list is empty.
----- another analysis -----
The potential errors in the code are:

1. No Node class defined or imported: The Node class has not been defined or imported leading to an Unresolved symbol error for Node. If the Node class is defined elsewhere in the package or separately in a library, its import line is missing.

2. No handling of null pointer exceptions: It may happen that hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor() is null (as hare.getSuccessor() may be the last node). This will cause the code to throw a null pointer exception.

3. Infinite loop: If the list doesn't have a cycle and ends at one point, the while (true) loop will become infinite as thereâ€™s no condition to break it.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DETECT_CYCLE {

    private class Node {
        Node successor;
        // Your data fields

        public Node getSuccessor() {
            return this.successor;
        }
    }

    public static boolean detect_cycle(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return false;
        }

        Node hare = node;
        Node tortoise = node;

        while (hare != null && hare.getSuccessor() != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.getSuccessor();
            hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor();

            if (hare == tortoise) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

In the corrected version, apart from defining the Node class, we handle the possible null pointer exception and prevent infinite loops by adjusting the condition in the while loop. The while loop now checks if hare or hare.getSuccessor() are null, if so, it breaks. This implies we have reached the end of the list and no cycle is present. If a cycle is there, eventually hare and tortoise will point to the same node, and we return true.

The main possible errors with this code are:

1. The `Node` class is not defined in the given piece of code. Also, functions `getSuccessor()` and `getSuccessor().getSuccessor()` are not defined.
2. If the linked list is not circular, i.e., it has an end, the line `hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor()` may throw a `NullPointerException` when the hare gets to the end of the list.

Here is the improved version of your code:

```java
class Node {
    public Node successor;

    Node(Node successor) {
        this.successor = successor;
    }

    public Node getSuccessor() {
        return this.successor;
    }
}

public class DETECT_CYCLE {
    public static boolean detect_cycle(Node node) {
        if(node == null)
            return false;

        Node hare = node;
        Node tortoise = node;

        while (true) {
            tortoise = tortoise.getSuccessor();
            if(hare.getSuccessor() != null)
                hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor();
            else
                return false;

            if (hare == null)
                return false;

            if (hare == tortoise)
                return true;
        }
    }
}
```

Here, a basic `Node` class is defined. For `DETECT_CYCLE`, null checks are added for both the initial `node` and for `hare.getSuccessor()` to avoid `NullPointerException`. Also, at each iteration, checked whether `hare` is `null` before comparing it with `tortoise`.
----- another analysis -----
The code itself seems fine but it could lead to a NullPointerException because it doesn't check if "hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor()" is null before assigning it to "hare". Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DETECT_CYCLE {
    public static boolean detect_cycle(Node node) {
        Node hare = node;
        Node tortoise = node;

        while (true) {
            if (hare.getSuccessor() == null)
                return false;

            tortoise = tortoise.getSuccessor();
            if (hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor() != null)
              hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor();
            else
              return false;

            if (hare == tortoise)
                return true;
        }
    }
}
```

In this revised code, we have added a check to see if the hare's successor's successor is null. If it is, we return false as it means there is no cycle.
----- another analysis -----
The code is detecting a cycle in a linked list by using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. The only issue in this algorithm is that it will throw NullPointerException if the hare node doesn't have a successor, as hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor() is not null checked.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DETECT_CYCLE {
    public static boolean detect_cycle(Node node) {
        Node hare = node;
        Node tortoise = node;

        while (true) {
            if (hare.getSuccessor() == null || hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor() == null)
                return false;

            tortoise = tortoise.getSuccessor();
            hare = hare.getSuccessor().getSuccessor();

            if (hare == tortoise)
                return true;
        }
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the hare node and hare's successor node are not null before proceeding to the next step. If either becomes null, it's a clear indication that our linked list doesn't have a cycle and hence, the function returns false.
