There are no syntax errors in the provided code. However, there are a few code style and safety improvements that could be made:

1. Use generics when declaring the Stack and ArrayList. Otherwise, you could face ClassCastException if you try to push an item of incompatible type. 
2. Before popping from the stack, checking if there are enough elements would add more reliability to the code.
3. Converting token to string is not necessary and could cause ClassCastException if for some reason a token is not a String or a Double.

Here is the improved code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

public class RPN_EVAL {
    public static Double rpn_eval(List<Object> tokens) {
        Map<String, BinaryOperator<Double>> operations = new HashMap<>();
        operations.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        operations.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        operations.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        operations.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);

        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (Object token : tokens) {
            if (token instanceof Double) {
                stack.push((Double) token);
            } else if (token instanceof String){
                if (stack.size() < 2) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Not enough operands for operation");
                }
                
                Double a = stack.pop();
                Double b = stack.pop();
                
                BinaryOperator<Double> operation = operations.get(token);
                if (operation == null) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid operation: " + token);
                }

                Double result = operation.apply(a, b);
                stack.push(result);
            }
        }

        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

The code essentially has no syntax errors but it might not work as expected due to certain logical errors. There are a few minor improvements needed:

1. Type declaration: We should make our stack type-specific for better type-safety. Right now, it's a raw type Stack, we can modify it to Stack<Double> to ensure we only add Doubles in our Stack.
2. Reverse order operation: While popping elements for the operation, the order should be reversed. This is because the second operand in an RPN expression becomes the top of the stack. So 'b' should be the result of the first pop, and 'a' should be the result of the second pop.
3. Token Casting: Casting token to String unnecessarily results 'token' to an Object. We can simply assign it to a new String variable like String operator = (String) token;

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

public class RPN_EVAL {
    public static Double rpn_eval(ArrayList tokens) {
        Map<String, BinaryOperator<Double>> op = new HashMap<>();
        op.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        op.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        op.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        op.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);

        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (Object token : tokens) {
            if (token instanceof Double) {
                stack.push((Double) token);
            } else {
                String operator = (String) token;
                Double a = stack.pop();
                Double b = stack.pop();
                BinaryOperator<Double> bin_op = op.get(operator);
                Double result = bin_op.apply(b, a);
                stack.push(result);
            }
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```
Note: The code doesn't check for underflow (stack with less than 2 items) or overflow (stack with more than maximum allowed Double values) conditions when popping/pushing from/into the stack. We should ideally handle these edge cases as well.
----- another analysis -----
Here are some potential issues:
- There are no type parameters in the ArrayList and Stack, which can lead to ClassCastException at runtime if unexpected types are used.
- It's not verifying if the stack has enough elements before doing any operations.
- It's assuming that any non-double values in the ArrayList are actually valid operators.
  
A more improved version of the code could look like this:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

public class RPN_EVAL {
    public static Double rpn_eval(List<String> tokens) {
        Map<String, BinaryOperator<Double>> op = new HashMap<>();
        op.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        op.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        op.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        op.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);

        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (String token : tokens) {
            try {
                stack.push(Double.parseDouble(token));
            } catch(NumberFormatException e){
                if (stack.size() < 2){
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient values in the stack");
                }
                BinaryOperator<Double> bin_op = op.get(token);
                if (bin_op == null) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid operator: " + token);
                }
                Double a = stack.pop();
                Double b = stack.pop();
                stack.push(bin_op.apply(b, a));
            }
        }

        if (stack.size()!=1){
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

This new version resolves the potential issues:
- It uses a generic List for input data and Stack specifically for Double type.
- Parse each token into a Double and if it fails, treats it as an operator.
- Checks if there enough elements and valid operators are used before applying operations.
- Ensures that only one result remains in the stack at the end.

The code is mostly correct, but there is an issue - potential class casting exceptions. It assumes that `ArrayList tokens` only contains `Double` and `String`. It doesn't check instance before casting it to `Double` or `String`, which could cause `ClassCastException`.

Here's the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

public class RPN_EVAL {
    public static Double rpn_eval(ArrayList<Object> tokens) {
        Map<String, BinaryOperator<Double>> op = new HashMap<>();
        op.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        op.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        op.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        op.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);

        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (Object token : tokens) {
            if (token instanceof Double) {
                stack.push((Double) token);
            } else if (token instanceof String) {
                Double a = stack.pop();
                Double b = stack.pop();
                BinaryOperator<Double> bin_op = op.get((String)token);
                Double c = bin_op.apply(b, a); // reverse a and b because of stack popping order
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }

        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

I have fixed the issue by introducing type parameters to `ArrayList` and `Stack` which specify the type of data they contain, and the instance checking before casting a token. This prevents unpredictable behavior and also makes the code safer by ensuring that only `Double` and `String` objects can be inserted into the `tokens` ArrayList and `stack`. 

Please note that also order of applying binary operation has been fixed as it must be "a OP b" and not "b OP a". Thus, objects from stack must be popped in a reversed order to align with this convention.
----- another analysis -----
There are major two errors here:

1. `ArrayList` declaration doesn't specify the type. It should be `ArrayList<Object> tokens`.
2. `Stack` declaration is a raw type. It should be `Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();` to ensure type safety.

Below is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

public class RPN_EVAL {
    public static Double rpn_eval(ArrayList<Object> tokens) {
        Map<String, BinaryOperator<Double>> op = new HashMap<>();
        op.put("+", (a, b) -> a + b);
        op.put("-", (a, b) -> a - b);
        op.put("*", (a, b) -> a * b);
        op.put("/", (a, b) -> a / b);

        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (Object token : tokens) {
            if (token instanceof Double) {
                stack.push((Double) token);
            } else {
                String operator = (String) token;
                Double a = stack.pop();
                Double b = stack.pop();
                BinaryOperator<Double> binaryOperator = op.get(operator);
                Double c = binaryOperator.apply(b,a);
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }
        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

Additionally, the order in which the operands are popped from the stack matters with subtraction and division. You should pop `b` before `a` to ensure the right calculation order when operator is subtraction or division.
