There are no syntax errors in the given Java code, but there is a logical error. The function next_palindrome attempts to find the next palindrome number given a number represented as an array of digits, but its logic is flawed. 

When increasing the middle digit(s) if it is 9, the code incorrectly makes them 0, and moves to the outer digits. This will not necessarily result in the next palindrome number. 

If the number 89398 was input (sent as an array of its digits), the function would incorrectly return 80308 instead of 89498.

The corrected version of the code that handles most of the palindromic scenarios should be following this logic: 

1. Compare the left and right halves of the number.
2. If the left half is greater than the right half reversed, mirror the left half over to the right half.
3. If the left half is less than or equal to the right half reversed, increase the left half by 1, and then mirror it over to the right half.

The corrected version of the function is quite complex, and goes beyond a simple fix. You would need to change the approach and iterate from the outermost digits inward, comparing pairs of digits. If the left digit is less than the right, increase the left side of the midpoint and mirror it to the right side. If the digits are equal, continue; if the left digit is greater than the right, just mirror the left side to the right side. This will entail substantial changes to the original code.

Please consider revisiting the logic and constraints of this problem.

The code seems logically incorrect. This is because:
1. It doesn't correctly calculate the next palindrome. Palindromes are numbers that read the same forward and backwards, and the current strategy of incrementing corresponding indices from the first half and second half of the array is likely to lead to non-palindrome numbers.
2. The code uses arrays, while using String would be more appropriate for this task. 

Here is the corrected code:
```
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PALINDROME {
    public static int next_palindrome(int num) {
        num++;
        while (!isPalindrome(num)) {
            num++;
        }
        return num;
    }
    
    private static boolean isPalindrome(int num) {
        String strNum = String.valueOf(num);
        int len = strNum.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
            if (strNum.charAt(i) != strNum.charAt(len - i - 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
This is a general approach. It increases the number until it becomes a palindrome. To check if a number is palindrome or not, it converts the number into a String and checks if it is the same when read from left to right and from right to left.

Note: If the input numbers are very large, this approach can be slow because it checks every number until it finds a palindrome. You can find more optimized approach to solve this problem or check if there is a predefined range for the input numbers.

This code has multiple problems. It's converting an integer array to string representation without ensuring it as a palindrome. It may lead wrong outputs for many input cases. Also, it is using integer array as input which is quite uncomfortable for the end user. Better to use integer input for simplicity.

Here is the correct code:

```java
// importing necessary classes
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PALINDROME {
    public static int reversePali(int num){
        int n = 0;
        while(num!=0){
            int dig = num % 10;
            n = n * 10 + dig;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return n;
    }
  
    public static int next_palindrome(int num) {
        while(true){
            num++;
            if(num == reversePali(num)){
                return num;
            }
        }
    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
  
        int num = 1221;
        System.out.println(next_palindrome(num));
    }
}
``` 

In this corrected version of code we are directly taking integer input and checking for next palindrome by incrementing and checking it with reverse. If both are equal we got our next palindrome otherwise we keep on checking for next numbers.

The code itself is syntactically okay, has no compilation issue, but it does have some logical issues, which may lead to incorrect results.

Firstly, this method will incorrectly return the string of array using `Arrays.toString()` that returns array in form [e1, e2, e3...].

Secondly, the code doesn't correctly identify an existing palindrome; it simply tries to create a new one regardless of the input. 

Lastly, the else block in the while loop only increments the current mid values and does not check if the incremented value still makes it a palindrome.

Correction:
```
public class NEXT_PALINDROME {
    public static String next_palindrome(int[] digit_list) {
        int high_mid = Math.floorDiv(digit_list.length, 2);
        int low_mid = Math.floorDiv(digit_list.length - 1, 2);

        while (high_mid < digit_list.length && low_mid >= 0) {
            if (digit_list[high_mid] == 9) {
                digit_list[high_mid] = 0;
                digit_list[low_mid] = 0;
                high_mid += 1;
                low_mid -= 1;
            } else {
                digit_list[high_mid] += 1;
                if (low_mid != high_mid) {
                    digit_list[low_mid] = digit_list[high_mid];
                }

                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                for (int i : digit_list) {
                    sb.append(i);
                }
                return sb.toString();
            }
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> otherwise = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        otherwise.add(1);
        otherwise.addAll(Collections.nCopies(digit_list.length, 0));
        otherwise.add(1);

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i : otherwise) {
            sb.append(i);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

The corrected code converts the int arrays to strings using StringBuilder for correct format and it also makes sure that changing the current mid value will still result in a palindrome.
----- another analysis -----
The source code provided has the following errors:
1. The provided Java code is designed to generate the next palindrome by manipulating an array of digits, however, it does not properly check whether the number it generates is truly a palindrome across all digit positions.
2. The return type of the method is String and converting arrays or ArrayLists using the 'Arrays.toString()' or 'String.valueOf()' methods gives the results in a specific format, which cannot be represented as a simple integer or numerical string.

Below is the corrected Java program logic to find the next smallest palindrome for a given number:

```java
public class NextPalindrome
{
	static int arr[];

	NextPalindrome(int n)
	{
		arr = new int[n];
	}

	static void generateNextPalindromeUtil(int n)
	{

		int mid = n / 2;

		boolean leftsmaller = false;

		int i = mid - 1;

		int j = (n % 2 == 1) ? mid + 1 : mid;

		while (i >= 0 && arr[i] == arr[j]) {
			i--; j++;
		}

		if (i < 0 || arr[i] < arr[j]) {
			leftsmaller = true;
		}

		while (i >= 0) {
			arr[j] = arr[i];
			j++;
			i--;
		}

		if (leftsmaller) {
			int carry = 1;
			i = mid - 1;

			if (n % 2 == 1) {
				arr[mid] += carry;
				carry = arr[mid] / 10;
				arr[mid] %= 10;
				j = mid + 1;
			}
			else
				j = mid;

			while (i >= 0) {
				arr[i] += carry;
				carry = arr[i] / 10;
				arr[i] %= 10;
				arr[j++] = arr[i--]; 
			}
		}
	}

	static void generateNextPalindrome(int n) 
	{ 
		int i;

		for ( i = 0; i < n; i++)
			System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");

		System.out.println();

		generateNextPalindromeUtil(n);


		System.out.println("Next palindrome is:");
		for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
			System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
	}
}
```
Usage:
Create an object of NextPalindrome by providing number of digits and then call generateNextPalindrome method by providing number of digits. 

```java
NextPalindrome p = new NextPalindrome(numberOfDigits);
p.generateNextPalindrome(numberOfDigits);
```
