Issues in the code:

1. The first condition in the second loop is wrong. We are checking 'if (perm.get(j) < perm.get(i))', but we should be checking 'if (perm.get(j) > perm.get(i))'.
2. When calculating the 'next_perm', the code is creating a reference to the 'perm' list, but not a new list. This means we aren't actually creating a new list, and changes to 'next_perm' will impact 'perm'.
3. The code which reverses part of 'next_perm' is incorrect. As it stands, the loop does not include value at index 'i'.
4. The loop variable 'q' starts with 'i+1', it will mess up the reversed list as it starts from 'i+1' to the end of the list. It will replace the value from 'i'.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PERMUTATION {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> next_permutation(ArrayList<Integer> perm) {
        ArrayList<Integer> next_perm = new ArrayList<>(perm);  // create a copy of perm
        for (int i = next_perm.size()-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (next_perm.get(i) < next_perm.get(i+1)) {
                for (int j = next_perm.size()-1; j > i; j--) {
                    if (next_perm.get(j) > next_perm.get(i)) {
                        // swap i and j
                        int temp = next_perm.get(i);
                        next_perm.set(i, next_perm.get(j));
                        next_perm.set(j, temp);
                        
                        // reverse the sequence after index i
                        int start = i+1;
                        int end = next_perm.size()-1;
                        while (start < end) {
                            temp = next_perm.get(start);
                            next_perm.set(start, next_perm.get(end));
                            next_perm.set(end, temp);
                            start++;
                            end--;
                        }

                        return next_perm;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return new ArrayList<Integer>();  // it's already the last permutation
    }
}
```
In this corrected code, we create a copy of 'perm' to avoid changing the original list. When we find two elements, 'i' and 'j' that meet the conditions for the next permutation, we swap them and reverse the sequence after 'i'. The reversal is done using two pointers approach, where we swap the elements at 'start' and 'end' until 'start' is not less than 'end'. And finally if we can't find two such elements, it means it's the last permutation so we return a new list.

Issues with given code:

1. In the inner for-loop, the if-statement should check if 'perm.get(j)' is greater than 'perm.get(i)' instead of less than.
2. In the reversing part, the initial value of 'k' should be 'next_perm.size()-1'.
3. The code will not correctly reverse the ArrayList after the ith index. It will add the reversed elements at the end of list not on the places starting from the index i+1.
4. ArrayList 'next_perm' isn't a new ArrayList, it is merely a reference to 'perm'.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PERMUTATION {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> next_permutation(ArrayList<Integer> perm) {
        if (perm == null || perm.size()<=1) return perm;
        
        int i = perm.size()-2;
        while (i >= 0 && perm.get(i) >= perm.get(i+1)) i--;
        
        if (i>=0) {
            int j=perm.size()-1;
            while (perm.get(j) <= perm.get(i)) j--;
            int temp_i = perm.get(i);
            perm.set(i,perm.get(j));
            perm.set(j,temp_i);
        }
        
        reverse(perm, i+1, perm.size()-1);
        return perm;
    }

    private static void reverse(ArrayList<Integer> perm, int i, int j){
        while(i < j){
            int temp = perm.get(i);
            perm.set(i, perm.get(j));
            perm.set(j, temp);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```
Explanation:

1. If the list is null or its size is less than or equal to 1, then return the list as it is.
2. Start from the last and find the first pair in descending order.
3. If such a pair is found, swap the right side element of it with smallest element on the right side of the list which is larger than that element.
4. Now, after the ith index, the list is in descending order. To find the smallest possible lexicographical order, we reverse this part.

The second if condition inside the nested loop checks if perm[j] is less than perm[i], but as per the next permutation algorithm, it needs to check if perm[j] is greater than perm[i]. Swapping should be done between the digits perm[i] and perm[j] where perm[j] is strictly greater than perm[i].

Also, the code is supposed to generate next permutation. But if no such permutation exists (i.e., input is the last permutation), it returns an empty array. Instead, it should return the first permutation (sorted in increasing order).

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PERMUTATION {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> next_permutation(ArrayList<Integer> perm) {
        for (int i=perm.size()-2; i!=-1; i--) {
            if (perm.get(i) < perm.get(i+1)) {
                for (int j=perm.size()-1; j!=i; j--) {
                    if (perm.get(j) > perm.get(i)) {
                        Collections.swap(perm, i, j); // Using built-in swap

                        Collections.reverse(perm.subList(i + 1,perm.size())); // Reversing the sublist

                        return perm;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(perm); // No next permutation exists. So, return the first permutation.
        return perm;
    }
}
```

In the corrected version, Collections.swap() is used for swapping elements and Collections.reverse() to reverse sublist. Instead of returning an empty ArrayList when no next permutation exists, the code now sorts perm and returns it (which is essentially the first permutation).

The logic used to swap the numbers and reverse the list after the swapping index is incorrect.

Also, the task of finding the next larger number to perm[i] and swapping them should be separate tasks. 

For the reversal part, the code is starting from the last index where it should start from the next index of i. 

Here is the corrected code: 

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PERMUTATION {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> next_permutation(ArrayList<Integer> perm) {
        for (int i = perm.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (perm.get(i) < perm.get(i + 1)) {
                for (int j = perm.size() - 1; j > i; j--) {
                    if (perm.get(j) > perm.get(i)) {
                        // Swap
                        int temp = perm.get(i);
                        perm.set(i, perm.get(j));
                        perm.set(j, temp);

                        // Reverse the list after i
                        int start = i + 1, end = perm.size() - 1;
                        while (start < end) {
                            temp = perm.get(start);
                            perm.set(start, perm.get(end));
                            perm.set(end, temp);
                            start++;
                            end--;
                        }
                        return perm;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // If no next permutation
        return new ArrayList<Integer>();
    }
}
```

This code iteratively looks for an index i from right to left such that perm[i] < perm[i+1]. Once we find such i, we look for a number greater than perm[i] from the right. We swap these numbers and reverse the array part after the swapping index 'i'. If no such i exist, then there is no next permutation, we return an empty arraylist.
----- another analysis -----
This method intends to find and return the next lexicographical permutation of an ArrayList of Integers but there are multiple logical errors in the code.

The main problems are:

1. This code doesn't properly find the next largest Integer to swap with the pivot.
2. The reversed ArrayList is not created appropriately.
3. The reversed ArrayList is not merged correctly to form the final permutation.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NEXT_PERMUTATION {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> next_permutation(ArrayList<Integer> perm) {
        int i=perm.size()-2;

        // Find first decreasing element
        while (i >= 0 && perm.get(i+1) <= perm.get(i)) {
            i--;
        }

        if (i>=0) {
            int j = perm.size() - 1;

            // Find swap position
            while (j >= 0 && perm.get(j) <= perm.get(i)) {
                j--;
            }

            // Swap
            Collections.swap(perm, i, j);
        }

        // Reverse suffix
        Collections.reverse(perm.subList(i+1, perm.size()));

        return perm;
    }
}
```

In this correction:

1. We find the first decreasing element from the right.
2. Then find the next largest element, which is on the right side of the pivot and swap them.
3. We reverse the second part to get the least possible lexicographical permutation arrangement.
