The code has multiple errors:

1. SUBSEQUENCES is not a standard Java class name. The naming convention in Java for classes is CamelCase.
2. ArrayLists objects are being declared without specified types.
3. The overuse of the ArrayList class can be simplified to make the code more readable.
4. The logic for generating subsequences is incorrect. The code currently tries to generate subsequences of integers between two numbers a and b of length k. However, it doesn't properly form subsequences since it's always inserting the current index i at the start of all its subsequences.

Here is the corrected version of the code with explanations:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SubSequences {
    public static List<List<Integer>> subsequences(int a, int b, int k) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        if (k == 0) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>());
            return result;
        }

        if(b-a+1 < k) {
            return result;
        }

        for (int i=a; i<=b-k+1; i++) { 
            List<List<Integer>> tails = subsequences(i+1, b, k-1);
            for (List<Integer> tail : tails) {
                List<Integer> subsequence = new ArrayList<>();
                subsequence.add(i);
                subsequence.addAll(tail);
                result.add(subsequence);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

This modified version correctly forms subsequences. The outer loop works by iteratively selecting each number in the range as the start of the subsequence. The inner loop, which calls the function recursively with a decremented k, generates all the subsequences of length k-1 from the remaining numbers. These subsequences are appended to the current start number to form subsequences of length k.

Errors:

1. The method `subsequences` is supposed to generate subsequences from a range of numbers. But in the base case, when k equals 0, it's simply returning an empty ArrayList without ArrayList, which would not be expected.

2. The way of recursively calling `subsequences` in the second for loop leads to ConcurrentModificationException because it's changing the list while iterating over it.

3. The usage of raw types ArrayList is not recommended due to the loss of type safety. 

4. Class name 'SUBSEQUENCES' does not follow standard naming conventions. It's recommended to use PascalCase for class names.

Here is the corrected version of this code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Subsequences {
    public static List<List<Integer>> subsequences(int a, int b, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
            result.add(new ArrayList<>());
            return result;
        }

        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = a; i <= b - k + 1; i++) {
            List<List<Integer>> subsequence = subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1);
            for (List<Integer> rest : subsequence) {
                rest.add(0, i);
                ret.add(new ArrayList<>(rest));
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

There are several issues in this code:

1. The method `subsequences(int a, int b, int k)` is supposed to return list of subsequences. However, the terminating condition of recursion, when `k` is 0, just returns an empty ArrayList. It should instead return a list containing an empty list.

2. The type of the elements within ArrayList is not specified. In Java, it's best practice to define the data type of the elements in the list, for type safety.

3. The increment condition in the outermost for loop is incorrect. It should be `i <= b-k+1` to correctly generate all subsequences.

4. Initialization of `base`inside for loop is not required, we can just add `rest` to `ret`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SUBSEQUENCES {
    public static ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> subsequences(int a, int b, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
            result.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
            return result;
        }

        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = a; i <= b - k + 1; i++) {
            for (ArrayList<Integer> rest : subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)) {
                rest.add(0, i);
                ret.add(rest);
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
}
```
This corrected code now correctly generates all `k`-length subsequences of a sequence from `a` to `b`. The ArrayList `ret` includes the type of its elements - they are ArrayLists of Integers. The base case of the recursive function (when `k` is 0) now returns a list of an empty list.

There are several issues in the code:

1. The method signature for "subsequences" should ideally take a sequence (array or list) as an argument rather than separate integers. It's not clear what is the intended use of `int a`, `int b`, and `int k`. If `a` and `b` are meant to define a range, and `k` is the length of subsequences, then it's not a problem, just a bit unclear.
2. The Java 8+ Stream API would be better suited for generating subsequences than recursive method calls.
3. The "subsequences" method returns a list of raw ArrayLists. Generic typing should be used for safety purposes.

Here's some simplified, clarified, but not the exact logic code that hopefully gets at what you're trying to do:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Subsequences {
    public static List<List<Integer>> subsequences(int a, int b, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }

        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = a; i <= b - k + 1; i++) {
            for (List<Integer> sub : subsequences(i + 1, b, k - 1)) {
                List<Integer> newSub = new ArrayList<>();
                newSub.add(i);
                newSub.addAll(sub);
                ret.add(newSub);
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
This code creates all subsequences of length `k` from a range of integers `a` to `b`. It uses the type `List<Integer>` instead of raw ArrayList, and does not limit the list size to 50 anymore as it's not necessary.
----- another analysis -----
The code attempts to generate all subsequences of given range but it contains few errors listed as follows:

1. The function subsequences should return List of List of Integer, not ArrayList of ArrayList.
2. The base case for the recursion is wrong. When k is zero, it is supposed to return a list which contains an empty list.
3. The type of the elements in the array list is not specified.
4. There's an off-by-one error in the end condition of the first for-loop.

Here's the corrected implementation of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SUBSEQUENCES {
    public static List<List<Integer>> subsequences(int a, int b, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
            result.add(new ArrayList<>());
            return result;
        }

        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=a; i<=b-k+1; i++) {
            List<List<Integer>> base = subsequences(i+1, b, k-1);
            for (List<Integer> rest : base) {
                rest.add(0,i);
                ret.add(rest);
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
}
```
