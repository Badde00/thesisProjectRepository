The errors in the code are:

1. The method `get_factors` only returns the first factor found if there is one, otherwise it returns an empty array list. This is due to that the recursion and return are situated inside the loop at the first successful modulo operation.

2. If the number itself is a prime number, this number would also be a factor but it is not added to the list.

A corrected version would be:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GetFactors {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> getFactors(int n) {
        ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
                n /= i;
            }
        }
        if(n > 1) {
            factors.add(n);
        }
        return factors;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we iterate over all possible factors. If `i` is a factor, we add it to the list and divide `n` by `i` until `i` is no longer a factor. Finally, any number remaining (`n > 1`) would be a factor itself (or n is 1), it is added to the list. This will give us a list of all primitive factors for `n`.

The code above has logical errors.

1. It is expected to return a list of factors of a given number, but it only returns a single factor and its associated factors, rather than all the factors of the input number. There is also a case when the number is prime or 1 when it returns an empty list instead of the number itself or its factors.

2. The ArrayList<Integer> prepend = new ArrayList<Integer>(0); is used to initialize an ArrayList with initial capacity of 0, but it makes no difference because the capacity of ArrayList increases automatically if more elements are added.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GET_FACTORS {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> get_factors(int n) {
        ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (int i=1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
            }
        }
        return factors;
    }
}
```

This corrected code checks every number from 1 to n inclusive, and if it is a factor it adds it into the list of factors. At the end, it return this list of factors.

The given code has some logical errors, some of which include:

1. If input 'n' is not divisible by any number in the given range, it returns an empty list, while it should return 'n' itself as it is a prime number.

2. The code only finds the first factor it encounters and does not find all the factors of 'n'. It returns after finding the first factor.

A corrected version of the code could look like this:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GET_FACTORS {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> get_factors(int n) {
        ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int max = (int)(Math.sqrt(n) + 1.0);
        for (int i=2; i < max; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
		        
                // Handle squares to avoid duplication
                if (i != n/i) {
                    factors.add(n / i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // To handle the case when 'n' is a prime number
        if(factors.size() == 0) {
            factors.add(n);
        }

        // Sorting the factors in ascending order
        Collections.sort(factors);
        
        return factors;
    }
}
```
This version gets all factors of the number 'n' (excluding 1 and the number itself). It also handles the case when 'n' is a prime number (i.e., add 'n' to the list of factors when there are no other factors). Additionally, it sorts the factors in ascending order before returning them.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code is intended to factorize a number (i.e return factors of a number), but it has several errors. It would only return the first set of factors it finds, rather than all factors. Also, it does not consider that 'n' itself is a factor of 'n'. Lastly, the code will fail to correctly handle when n = 1, as it should return [1] instead of an empty list.

Corrected version:

import java.util.*;

public class GetFactors {
    public static List<Integer> getFactors(int n){
        List<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++){
            if(n % i == 0){
                factors.add(i);
                if(n / i != i) {
                    factors.add(n / i);
                }
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(factors);
        return factors;
    }
}
In the corrected code, I renamed the class to GetFactors, to follow the correct Java naming conventions. I also fixed the method name to getFactors, as per Java naming conventions. I modified the logic to capture all factors, including n itself, and then sorted them before returning. The code now also captures 1 as a factor.
----- another analysis -----
The code won't always give expected outputs. There are two significant issues:

1. If 'n' has no factors (e.g., it is a prime number), the code will return an empty list which is incorrect - in such cases, the list should contain 'n' itself.
2. The code is supposed to find all factors, but it stops as soon as it encounters the first factor. 

Remember, the 'for' loop won't cycle when it reaches the 'return' statement. Revised code:

```Java
import java.util.*;

public class GET_FACTORS {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> get_factors(int n) {
        ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        if (n == 1) {
            factors.add(1);
            return factors;
        }
        int max = (int)(Math.sqrt(n) + 1.0);
        for (int i=1; i <= max; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                // If divisors are equal, add only one
                if (n / i == i) {
                    factors.add(i);
                } else {
                    // Otherwise add both
                    factors.add(i);
                    factors.add(n / i);
                }
            }
        }
        return factors;
    }
}
```
This code starts the loop from 1 to include 'n' and 1 in the factor list. It also adds both factors to the list when 'n' is divisible by 'i'. If 'i' and 'n/i' are the same (i.e., 'n' is a perfect square), it ensures each factor is only added once. This will make the code return all factors of 'n'.
