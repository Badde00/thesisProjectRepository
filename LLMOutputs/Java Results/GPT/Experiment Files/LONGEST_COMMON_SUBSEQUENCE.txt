The code has logical errors. When a character match is found, the function does not advance the index of b, which can generate incorrect results. Also, the code will result in a lot of repeated calculations which will make it inefficient for larger strings.

Here is the corrected version of a code with a more efficient algorithm using Dynamic Programming.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE {
    public static String longest_common_subsequence(String a, String b) {
        int[][] dp = new int[a.length()+1][b.length()+1];
        
        for(int i=1; i<=a.length(); i++){
            for(int j=1; j<=b.length(); j++){
                if(a.charAt(i-1) == b.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = a.length(), j = b.length();
        while(i>0 && j>0) {
            if(a.charAt(i-1) == b.charAt(j-1)){
                result.append(a.charAt(i-1));
                i--;
                j--;
            } else if(dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]){
                i--;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }
        
        return result.reverse().toString();
    }
}
``` 

This solution uses a Dynamic Programming approach to solve the problem efficiently. It creates a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the length of the longest common subsequence of strings 'a' and 'b' up to indices 'i' and 'j'. It then constructs the LCS from this DP table.

The code seems to have logic error. If the first character of the two strings is equal, the function should continue to find the longest common subsequence of the remaining part of both strings, not just the remaining part of string a.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE {
    public static String longest_common_subsequence(String a, String b) {
        if (a.isEmpty() || b.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        } else if (a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)) {
            return a.charAt(0) + longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b.substring(1));
        } else {
            String fst = longest_common_subsequence(a, b.substring(1));
            String snd = longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b);
            return fst.length() >= snd.length() ? fst : snd;
        }
    }
}
```

An explanation of the adjustment: when the first characters of a and b are equal, we should take the remaining characters of both a and b to find the common subsequence, rather than just taking the remaining characters of a. Therefore, we should call `longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b.substring(1))` instead of `longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b)`.
----- another analysis -----
There are no syntax errors present, but functionally there might be something off with the logic that could be improved. When there is a match in the first characters of both strings (a and b), the algorithm returns the character plus the result of the remainder of string 'a' and the full string 'b'. This means if the first characters of the strings are matches, it won't consider the rest of string 'b', it will only focus on string 'a'.

Below is the corrected version:

```
import java.util.*;

public class LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE {
    public static String longest_common_subsequence(String a, String b) {
        if (a.isEmpty() || b.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        } else if (a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)) {
            return a.charAt(0) + longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b.substring(1));
        } else {
            String fst = longest_common_subsequence(a, b.substring(1));
            String snd = longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b);
            return fst.length() >= snd.length() ? fst : snd;
        }
    }
}
```
In the corrected version, if the first characters of strings 'a' and 'b' match, both strings move one character forward. This way, the algorithm considers both 'a' and 'b' equally.
----- another analysis -----
Error:
The current implementation fails to remove the first character in string `b` in the condition where `a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)`. The function ends up in an endless recursion state hence causing a StackOverflowError in cases where `a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)`.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE {
    public static String longest_common_subsequence(String a, String b) {
        if (a.isEmpty() || b.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        } else if (a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)) {
            return a.charAt(0) + longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b.substring(1));
        } else {
            String fst = longest_common_subsequence(a, b.substring(1));
            String snd = longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b);
            return fst.length() >= snd.length() ? fst : snd;
        }

    }
}
```

Explanation: 
In the corrected version, if the first characters of the strings `a` and `b` match, we moved both of the pointers in `a` and `b` to their next characters. Otherwise, we continue the recursion by moving only one of the pointers to the next character in each chain.
----- another analysis -----
The logic inside the function longest_common_subsequence is incorrect. For case where the current characters of both strings don't match (else part), it must compare both possibilities, one where string 'a' is reduced, and other where string 'b' is reduced. 

Here is the corrected version :

import java.util.*;

public class LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE {
    public static String longest_common_subsequence(String a, String b) {
        if (a.isEmpty() || b.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        } if (a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)) {
            return a.charAt(0) + longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b.substring(1));
        } else {
            String fst = longest_common_subsequence(a, b.substring(1));
            String snd = longest_common_subsequence(a.substring(1), b);
            return fst.length() >= snd.length() ? fst : snd;
        }

    }

}

In the corrected version, I included substring calls to both 'a' and 'b' when there is a match. When there is no match, checks are performed to identify which line between 'a' and 'b' provides the longer subsequence. Moreover, it should be noted that, for large inputs this approach could cause a StackOverflowError due to recursion. It would be more efficient to implement it using dynamic programming and deleting all these recursive lines of the method to avoid this error.
