The code provided is an implementation of the kheapsort function. The function tries to sort a subset of k elements from an array with integers. However, there are some errors:

1. The first for-loop is supposed to add first k elements of the array to the heap, but it's not necessary because all elements are added to the heap in the second loop anyways.

2. In the second for-loop, algorithm not only inserts every element one by one (correct), but also removes the smallest one (incorrect). 

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KHEAPSORT {

    public static List<Integer> kheapsort(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>(arr.subList(0, Math.min(k, arr.size())));

        List<Integer> output = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            if (heap.size() < k) {
                heap.add(x);
            } else if (x > heap.peek()) {
                heap.poll();
                heap.add(x);
            }
        }

        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        Collections.reverse(output);
        return output;

    }
}
```
The return type is changed to `List<Integer>` to make the function more flexible by allowing different types of lists as input. Our algorithm takes the list `arr`, and for each element, we add it to the heap if the heap has less than `k` elements or if the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap. The function returns the top `k` elements in descending order. The output list is reversed at the end to show the top `k` elements in descending order.
The function now works in time `O(n log k)`, which is optimal for this problem. In the original code, the time complexity was `O(n log n)`, which is worse when `k << n`.

This Java code is almost correct. It represents a k-heapsort algorithm. However, there is a small error that causes it to not work correctly. 

The method should only start adding elements from the PriorityQueue and inserting in the output ArrayList from the k-th element instead of the 0-th. It inserts k elements to the heap first (0 to k-1) but then it starts adding and extracting from the index 0 again. This results in duplicated and unsorted numbers in the output list.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```Java
import java.util.*;

public class KHEAPSORT {

    public static ArrayList<Integer> kheapsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        for (Integer v : arr.subList(0,k)) {
            heap.add(v);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> output = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (Integer x : arr.subList(k, arr.size())) {
            heap.add(x);
            Integer popped = heap.poll();
            output.add(popped);
        }

        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        return output;

    }
}
```

In this corrected code, in the second for-each loop, arr starts from k-th index instead of the 0-th index. This ensures that each element is inserted to the heap, extracted, and added to the output list only once. It ensures that the output list is sorted, and there are no duplicated numbers.

The code has logical errors in it. The primary error is that every element from the array list 'arr' has been added twice to the 'heap' object. First time in the arr.subList loop (only the first k elements) and second time in the arr loop (all elements of arr). 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KHEAPSORT {

    public static ArrayList<Integer> kheapsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
      
        for (Integer v : arr) {
            heap.add(v);
            if (heap.size() > k) {
                heap.poll();
            }
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> output = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        Collections.reverse(output);
        return output;
    }
}
```

This corrected code's intent is to return the k largest elements from 'arr' in descending order. If we want the k smallest elements, we would not need to reverse the list.
The 'heap' is maintained at size 'k'. In each iteration, if the size of 'heap' is larger than 'k', the smallest element (which is at the root of MinHeap) is removed.
At the end of this process, 'heap' will contain the k largest elements from 'arr', with the smallest of these at the root of 'heap'. The 'output' list is populated by repeatedly polling 'heap' (which always removes the root element), and then reversed to give a list in descending order.
----- another analysis -----
The code above is trying to implement a kind of heap sort that adds the first k elements of array to a min heap, and then starts adding remaining elements in the array, while simultaneously removing the smallest element from the heap. 

However, there's an edge case this code fails: what if the size of the input array is smaller than k? In that case `arr.subList(0,k)` will throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

There's also one logical error in the second for each loop: we're double adding elements to 'heap', first when k elements were added initially and then when looping through 'arr'.

A better version of the code would be as follows:

```
import java.util.*;

public class KHEAPSORT {

    public static ArrayList<Integer> kheapsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();

        int index = 0;
        while(index < Math.min(k, arr.size())) {
            heap.add(arr.get(index++));
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> output = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        while(index < arr.size()) {
            heap.add(arr.get(index));
            Integer popped = heap.poll();
            output.add(popped);
            index++;
        }

        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        return output;
    }
}
```
In this revised version, we first add the minimum of 'k' or the size of 'arr' elements to the heap and then start adding the remaining elements in 'arr' to the heap while simultaneously removing the smallest element in the heap. This way, we ensure we don't double add elements and prevent 'IndexOutOfBoundsException'.
----- another analysis -----
The sample code is almost correct. However, it has a logic problem that happens when K is greater than the size of the array. In that scenario, the first "for" loop could throw an "IndexOutOfBoundsException". 

Here is the corrected version that is also safe for cases when K is greater than the size of arr:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KHEAPSORT {

    public static ArrayList<Integer> kheapsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        
        int size = k < arr.size() ? k : arr.size();
        
        for (Integer v : arr.subList(0,size)) {
            heap.add(v);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> output = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            heap.add(x);
            Integer popped = heap.poll();
            output.add(popped);
        }

        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        return output;
    }
}
``` 

The line `int size = k < arr.size() ? k : arr.size();` has been added so that we don't try to access an array index that is out of bounds.
