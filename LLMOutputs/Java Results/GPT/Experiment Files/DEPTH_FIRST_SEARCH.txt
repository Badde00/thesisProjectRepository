There are no syntax errors in the provided code, but there is a logical error. Specifically, once a node is visited, it is not being added to the visited node set. Because of this, the same node could get visited multiple times in an infinite loop, especially in graphs with cycles. The corrected version of the code is below:

```Java
import java.util.*;

public class DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH {
    public static boolean depth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (nodesvisited.contains(node)) {
                    return false;
                } else if (node == goalnode) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    nodesvisited.add(node); // Add node to visited after visiting
                    for (Node successornodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if (search(successornodes)) { return true; }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startnode);
    }

}
```

Adding `nodesvisited.add(node);` right after checking if the node is not in visited set, prevents infinite loops or redundant searches when cycles are present in the graph.
----- another analysis -----
The major error in the code is that, the Set nodesvisited that is supposed to keep track of the visited nodes never actually updates itself with the visited nodes. Without this, the depth-first-search can enter an infinite loop if there is a cycle in the graph. Beyond this, there are no syntax errors in the code provided, although some better practices could be applied.

The corrected code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH {
    public static boolean depth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (nodesvisited.contains(node)) {
                    return false;
                } else if (node == goalnode) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    nodesvisited.add(node); //Add visited node
                    for (Node successornodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if(search(successornodes)) { return true; }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startnode);
    }

}
```

An additional note would be that without having a view of the Node class, we can't verify if the method getSuccessors() exists and correctly fetches the successor nodes for a given node. If it does not, then you would need to define such a method within the Node class or adjust the code accordingly.
----- another analysis -----
The code is logically correct in terms of the Depth-First Search algorithm, but there is a mistake. In the search method, after visiting a node, it should be marked as visited, which is missing in this current solution. As a result, the algorithm can enter infinite loops in structures with cycles.

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH {
    public static boolean depth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (node == goalnode) {
                    return true;
                } else if (!nodesvisited.contains(node)) {
                    nodesvisited.add(node);
                    for (Node successornodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if (search(successornodes)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startnode);
    }
}
```

The updated line "nodesvisited.add(node);" after checking that the node was not previously visited ensures that each node is only visited once, mitigating chances of infinite loops.
----- another analysis -----
There doesn't seem to be any technical errors with this code. However, it does lack certain good practices such as:

1. Class names in Java should follow CamelCase conventions. So, "DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH" would be better as "DepthFirstSearch".
2. Method names in Java should start with a lowercase letter. So, "depth_first_search" would be "depthFirstSearch".
3. The names "startnode" and "goalnode" would be more readable as "startNode" and "goalNode".

Fixed code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DepthFirstSearch {
    public static boolean depthFirstSearch(Node startNode, Node goalNode) {
        Set<Node> nodesVisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (nodesVisited.contains(node)) {
                    return false;
                } else if (node == goalNode) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    for (Node successorNodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if (search(successorNodes)) { return true; }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startNode);
    }

}
```

However, it is important to note that we don't add visited nodes into the nodesVisited set in this code. It may lead to an infinite loop if there is a cycle in the graph. 
Thus, you need to include the line "nodesVisited.add(node);" inside the "search" function just below where we check if the node is in "nodesVisited" but before we loop over successor nodes.

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DepthFirstSearch {
    public static boolean depthFirstSearch(Node startNode, Node goalNode) {
        Set<Node> nodesVisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (nodesVisited.contains(node)) {
                    return false;
                } 
                nodesVisited.add(node);
                if (node == goalNode) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    for (Node successorNodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if (search(successorNodes)) { return true; }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startNode);
    }

}
```
----- another analysis -----
No explicit errors are present in this code. It follows the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm by checking if the node has been visited before. If not, it explores all the node's successors recursively. If it comes across the goal node during this exploration, it returns true, accomplishing the search.

However, nodes explored during a failed path search are not added to the "nodesvisited" set. This means the search might cover the same nodes multiple times unnecessarily, which is inefficient. Each visited node should be added to the "nodesvisited" set to track the places where we have already been.

Here's the corrected version where each visited node is added to the "nodesvisited" Set:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH {
    public static boolean depth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();
        class Search {
            boolean search(Node node) {
                if (nodesvisited.contains(node)) {
                    return false;
                } 
                nodesvisited.add(node);
                
                if (node == goalnode) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    for (Node successornodes : node.getSuccessors()) {
                        if (search(successornodes)) { return true; }
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        };

        Search s = new Search();
        return s.search(startnode);
    }

}
```

Now, each time a node is visited, it's added to the 'nodesvisited' set, ensuring no node is unnecessarily visited multiple times.
