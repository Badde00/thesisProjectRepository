Errors:

1. The method 'flatten' calls itself indefinitely if 'arr' is not an instance of ArrayList. This would result in a StackOverflowError.

2. The method 'flatten' seems to be intended for flattening nested lists. However, when it encounters an element that is not a list, it's trying to flatten it, which is unnecessary and incorrect, it should just add it to the result.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FLATTEN {
    public static List<Object> flatten(Object arr) {
        if (arr instanceof ArrayList) {
            ArrayList<Object> narr = (ArrayList<Object>) arr;
            List<Object> result = new ArrayList<>();
            for (Object x : narr) {
                if (x instanceof ArrayList) {
                    result.addAll(flatten(x));
                } else {
                    result.add(x);
                }
            }
            return result;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input must be an ArrayList.");
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

The method signature was changed to `List<Object>` for the returned type as we should not return the base class type 'Object' when we know our function should return an 'ArrayList'. When 'arr' is not an instance of 'ArrayList', the corrected method now throws an IllegalArgumentException instead of calling itself. This is indicative that this method only handle ArrayLists. 

If 'x' is not an ArrayList, it simply adds 'x' to 'result' without trying to flatten it. Also, the initial capacity of the 'result' list was removed, as 'ArrayList' can grow dynamically, it doesn't need to be set initially when it's not known.

The code has a logical error. There's a recursive loop that will never terminate in the else branch (return flatten(arr);). The goal of this part looks to be to return non-array items. Therefore, in this case, we should simply return arr rather than recursively call flatten(arr) again.

Corrected Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Flatten {
    public static ArrayList<Object> flatten(Object arr) {
        if (arr instanceof ArrayList) {
            ArrayList<Object> narr = (ArrayList<Object>) arr;
            ArrayList<Object> result = new ArrayList<Object>();
            for (Object x : narr) {
                if (x instanceof ArrayList) {
                    result.addAll(flatten(x));
                } else {
                    result.add(x); 
                }
            }
            return result;
        } else {  
            ArrayList<Object> result = new ArrayList<Object>();
            result.add(arr);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

Changes:
1. Changed the name of the class to Camel case applied in Java.
2. Replace function return type Object to ArrayList<Object> for more specific type.
3. Add generics (Object) to ArrayList type followed by Java's type safety.
4. Change ArrayList size from 50 to default as size isn't necessary and may be misguiding.
5. Replace recursive call of flatten(arr) with x in if branch inside for loop.
6. In else condition change to return an array list that contains arr instead of calling the method recursively to avoid endless recursion.

Errors identified in the code:

1. Recursive call to flatten is in else block without a termination condition. This would result in an infinite loop during the execution.
2. The method is not correctly identifying and handling when the input is a non-array element or it is a single individual element instead of the array.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FLATTEN {
    public static List<Object> flatten(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof List<?>) {
            List<Object> result = new ArrayList<Object>();
            for (Object sublist : (List<?>) obj) {
                result.addAll(flatten(sublist));
            }
            return result;
        } 
        else {
            List<Object> result = new ArrayList<Object>();
            result.add(obj);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

The solution code checks whether the input object is a list or an individual element. If it's a list, it's flattened recursively, and elements are added to the result list. If it's an individual element, it's added to the result list directly.
----- another analysis -----
The code appears to have a recursion problem in the else branch where it calls the "flatten()" method on a single, non-Array list object. This would lead to an infinite recursion loop, eventually causing a StackOverflowError because there is no base case where the recursion would stop.

Corrected code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class FLATTEN {
    public static Object flatten(Object arr) {
        if (arr instanceof ArrayList) {
            ArrayList narr = (ArrayList) arr;
            ArrayList result = new ArrayList(50);
            for (Object x : narr) {
                if (x instanceof ArrayList) {
                    result.addAll((ArrayList) flatten(x));
                } else {
                    result.add(x);        // replace flatten(x) with x
                }
            }
            return result;
        } else {
            return arr;       // replace flatten(arr) with arr
        }
    }
}
```
In the corrected code, when x is not an instance of ArrayList, we directly add x to the result because x is already a flattened object. Also, if arr is not an instance of ArrayList, we directly return arr as arr is already a flattened object.
----- another analysis -----
The code provided has a fundamental logic error. 

#### Errors
- The issue is in the `else` clause of the `flatten` function where it recursively calls `flatten` with the same object that has triggered the `else` clause. This means that it goes into an infinite recursive call with non-ArrayList objects resulting in a `StackOverflowError`. 
- Type inconsistency: the function returns an `ArrayList` object in some cases but could return other types in others; it's preferable to return consistent types.
- There is no base case for the recursion in the `else` clause.

#### Corrected Code
The corrected code for the `flatten` function should not recursively call `flatten` on `arr` in the `else` clause.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FLATTEN {
    public static ArrayList<Object> flatten(Object arr) {
        ArrayList<Object> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (arr instanceof ArrayList) {
            ArrayList<Object> narr = (ArrayList<Object>) arr;
            for (Object x : narr) {
                if (x instanceof ArrayList) {
                    result.addAll(flatten(x));
                } else {
                    result.add(x);
                }
            }
        } else {
            result.add(arr);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

By modifying the code like this, the method will return a flattened ArrayList for an input ArrayList. If the input object is not an ArrayList, it simply returns a new ArrayList containing the object as the only element. This ensures the type consistency of the return value as well.
