The code contains an infinite recursion error. If `x` is not present in the array or is present at the boundary of the search space, the search loop never exits, thus causing a stack overflow error due to infinite recursion. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class FIND_IN_SORTED {
    public static int binsearch(int[] arr, int x, int start, int end) {
        if (start >= end) {
            return -1;
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (x < arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, start, mid);
        } else if (x > arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }

    public static int find_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        return binsearch(arr, x, 0, arr.length);
    }
}
```

In the corrected code, `start >= end` condition is used to exit recursion when the search space is empty. Also, in each recursion step `mid + 1` is used as the new `start` index when `x` is greater than the middle element of the current search space, this ensures that the search space gets smaller with each recursive call, and prevents the potential infinite recursion.
----- another analysis -----
The code seems correct, but it can lead to an infinite recursive loop to occur if the "x" element is not found in the array. Because the `binsearch` function only updates `mid` in each recursion, the `start` and `end` values can repeatedly take the same values and therefore cause an infinite loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class FIND_IN_SORTED {
    public static int binsearch(int[] arr, int x, int start, int end) {
        if (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (x < arr[mid]) {
                return binsearch(arr, x, start, mid);
            } else if (x > arr[mid]) {
                return binsearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -(start + 1); // return a unary minus to show where it would belong
    }

    public static int find_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        return binsearch(arr, x, 0, arr.length);
    }
}
```
This change ensures that when x is not found `binsearch` function doesn't enter into an infinite recursive loop. If `x > arr[mid]`, `mid + 1` is passed as the start for next recursive call. Also if search reaches to end and cannot find it, it will return number in unary minus.
----- another analysis -----
There are two logical errors in this code related to infinite recursion:

1. If `start == end`, the method should not necessarily return `-1`. It should check if the `arr[start]` is equal to `x` before returning `-1`.
2. The method `binsearch` calls itself recursively with identical arguments when `x` is less than `arr[mid]` or greater than `arr[mid]`. This could lead to infinite recursion and a stack overflow error because the `start` or the `end` index of the subarray is not changing. If `x` is less than `arr[mid]`, `mid` should be decreased by 1 to change the `end` index. Similarly, if `x` is greater than `arr[mid]`, `mid` should be increased by 1 to change the `start` index.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class FIND_IN_SORTED {
    public static int binsearch(int[] arr, int x, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return -1;
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (x < arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, start, mid - 1);
        } else if (x > arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }

    public static int find_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        return binsearch(arr, x, 0, arr.length - 1);
    }
}
```

With these changes, the Errors are fixed and code will work correctly for searching an element in a sorted array using binary search.
----- another analysis -----
There are infinite recursion errors in the code. The binary search function does not correctly take care of the edge case when the element is not in the array, leading to infinite recursion.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
public class FIND_IN_SORTED {
    public static int binsearch(int[] arr, int x, int start, int end) {
        if (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // middle element

            if (x < arr[mid]) {
                return binsearch(arr, x, start, mid);
            } else if (x > arr[mid]) {
                return binsearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
            } else {
                return mid;  // element found
            }
        }
        return -1;  // element not found
        
    }

    public static int find_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        return binsearch(arr, x, 0, arr.length);
    }
}
```

In the corrected version, the binary search function now also checks for the condition 'start < end'. This fixes issues when the element is not in the array (prevents infinite recursion). Also, while calling the binary search for the second half of the array, we pass 'mid + 1' instead of 'mid' to prevent possible infinite recursion.
----- another analysis -----
The code given is a binary search algorithm. It recursively divides the sorted array into two halves until it finds the target value or until the array cannot be divided further. However, there's an infinite recursion error. The mid-index might not be excluded when the next recursion search is performed.

Here's the corrected code:

```
public class FIND_IN_SORTED {
    public static int binsearch(int[] arr, int x, int start, int end) {
        if (start >= end) {
            return -1;
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (x < arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, start, mid);
        } else if (x > arr[mid]) {
            return binsearch(arr, x, mid+1, end);  // Error was here: in case of x > arr[mid], start should be mid + 1 not mid.
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }

    public static int find_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        return binsearch(arr, x, 0, arr.length);
    }
}
```
Explanation: We need to start from `mid + 1` instead of `mid` when x > arr[mid] to avoid infinite recursion because if the 'mid' is not excluded in the next search space, the same 'mid' might be calculated over and over again, leading to an infinite recursion.
