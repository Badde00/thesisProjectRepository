The code is mostly correct with only one logical error, where it computes the absolute difference between 'x' and 'approx'. The correct formula for the while loop condition is absolute difference between 'x' and the square of 'approx'. Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SQRT {
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approx = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This is a common method to compute the square root using Newton's method. You start with some guess (here 'x'/2) and make successive guesses that bring you closer to the real square root. The loop will exit when error is smaller than specified epsilon.

The provided Java code seems correct. It implements Newton's method for calculating the square root of a number. 

However, one thing to note would be that the sqrt() function does not check whether the input number x is negative. In real mathematics, the square root of a negative number is not defined for real number space but in the complex number space as it involves 'i', the imaginary unit. 

In the code, if a negative number is passed in the method, it will go into an infinite loop. So add a check for negative values:

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SQRT {
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        if (x < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input values must be positive");
        }
        double approx = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}
```

Here, an exception is thrown when a negative number is given as input. Also, the condition inside the while-loop is updated to correct the logic of the algorithm. The difference between the square of the current approximation and the original number x is calculated, as the loop needs to tighten the approximation until the square of the approximation is close enough (within epsilon) to x.

The code seems to be implementing a version of the Babylonian method to calculate the square root of a number. However, the error lies within the while loop condition where it checks for the absolute difference between the number 'x' and 'approx'. This should not be 'x' but the square of 'approx'. The corrected version is:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SQRT {
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approx = x / 2.0;
        while (Math.abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}
```

This version of code correctly implement the square root function, continuing the approximation while the square of the current approximation is not within epsilon of the desired number.
----- another analysis -----
The provided Java code is correct. It calculates the square root of a given number 'x' with an error margin 'epsilon'. The Babylonian method (a kind of approximation method) is used here for determining the square root. 

So, there are no errors to list and no corrections to make.
----- another analysis -----
The presented code seems almost correct. It attempts to calculate the square root of a number using the Newton's method. However, there is a minor logical mistake in the while loop condition. 

The difference between the square of the approximation and the original number should be checked against the epsilon, not the difference between the approximation and the original number itself.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SQRT {
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approx = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - (approx*approx)) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}
```

With this modification, the code should correctly calculate square roots within the error margin given by epsilon.
