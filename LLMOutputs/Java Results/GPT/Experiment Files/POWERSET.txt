The major issues include: 

1. The usage of raw types with ArrayList, we need to specify the type. 
2. The reduction of input ArrayList, which could potentially cause errors when the function is called again. 
3. The logic of generating the powerset is incorrect, as it currently just merges and clusters all subsets into a single set. 

Here is a corrected version with fixes: 

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PowerSet {
    public static ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> powerSet(ArrayList<Object> arr) {
        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            ArrayList<Object> innerList = new ArrayList<>();
            ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> outerList = new ArrayList<>();
            outerList.add(innerList);
            return outerList;
        } 

        Object first = arr.remove(0); 
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> restSubset = powerSet(arr);

        ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> output = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>>();
        output.addAll(restSubset);

        for(ArrayList<Object> subset: restSubset) {
            ArrayList<Object> newList = new ArrayList<>();
            newList.add(first);
            newList.addAll(subset);
            output.add(newList);
        }

        arr.add(0, first);
        return output;
    }
}
```

This corrected code provides the correct power set logic, it also specifies the type of ArrayLists and manages the list alteration appropriately. It starts from an empty list and for each element in input array, it first removes that element, then calculates power sets for remaining elements, and finally combines the removed element with these subsets to add into the final output.

This function appears to be trying to generate the powerset of an array (all possible subsets). However, it has some errors:

1. In its current state, the code removes elements of the original list one by one until list is empty. Each time it forms only one subset starting from one element, and returns without considering other subsets.
2. Recursive call results (all subsets of remaining elements) are not added to the result.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PowerSet {
    public static List<List<Object>> powerset(List<Object> arr) {
        List<List<Object>> subsets = new ArrayList<>();
        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            subsets.add(new ArrayList<>()); // Add empty set
            return subsets;
        }

        Object first = arr.get(0);
        List<Object> rest = new ArrayList<>(arr.subList(1, arr.size()));
        
        for (List<Object> subset : powerset(rest)) {
            // without current item
            subsets.add(new ArrayList<>(subset));

            // with current item
            List<Object> newSubset = new ArrayList<>(subset);
            newSubset.add(first);
            subsets.add(newSubset);
        }
        return subsets;
    }
}
```

This code now properly generates the powerset recursively, by spliting the set into "first" and "rest", and for each subset of "rest", adding new subsets with and without "first". 

Note: 

- It is recommended to use `List` as declaration instead of `ArrayList` as It makes your program More flexible.
- Java classes should be in `CamelCase` without underscores. Here, `PowerSet` would be a more appropriate class name according to java naming conventions.

Errors:

1. Generic type for ArrayList is missing.
2. The powerset method removes items from the passed ArrayList, causing side effects outside of the method. Within the recursion, changes to ArrayList affect all recursive stages, creating an incorrect output.
3. The for loop which adds subsets to the "to_add" list, doesn't make a new subset for each. It is hence adding elements in the same list repeatedly. 
4. The subsets from the rest_subsets are not added to the output.
5. ArrayList size is not required to be specified at initialization.
6. When removing the first element from the ArrayList, consecutive elements are shifted left, changing their original order.

Corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PowerSet {
    public static ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> powerSet(ArrayList<Object> arr) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> output = new ArrayList<>();

        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(new ArrayList<>());
            return output;
        }

        Object first = arr.get(0);
        ArrayList<Object> rest = new ArrayList<>(arr.subList(1, arr.size()));

        for (ArrayList<Object> subset : powerSet(rest)) {
            ArrayList<Object> newSubset = new ArrayList<>(subset);
            newSubset.add(first);
            output.add(newSubset);
            output.add(subset);
        }

        return output;
    }
}
``` 

Explanation: The corrected code first checks if the input ArrayList is empty. If it is, an empty set is returned (as the power set of an empty set is a set containing an empty set). If not, it assigns the first element of the list and the rest. For each subset of the recursive call, it adds the subset with and without the first element to achieve the power set.
----- another analysis -----
The code attempts to compute a powerset (set of all subsets) for a set, but it has some issues:

1. The recursive step does not correctly construct the powerset. For each subset of 'rest' (the original set minus 'first'), it should add two subsets to the output: the subset itself, and the subset plus 'first'. In the present code, each iteration of the loop adds all elements of 'subset' to 'to_add'. 
2. When removing the first element from the array, it directly affects the original list passed to the function. Instead it should create a new list 'rest' that doesn't include the first element.

Here's the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POWERSET {
    public static ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> powerset(ArrayList<Object> arr) {
        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            // Base case: add an empty set
            ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> emptySet = new ArrayList<>();
            emptySet.add(new ArrayList<>());
            return emptySet;
        } else {
            // Recursive case
            Object first = arr.get(0);
            ArrayList<Object> rest = new ArrayList<>(arr);
            rest.remove(0);

            ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> restSubsets = powerset(rest);

            ArrayList<ArrayList<Object>> output = new ArrayList<>();

            // Add subsets with and without the first element
            for (ArrayList<Object> subset : restSubsets) {
                // First, add the subset without the first element
                output.add(new ArrayList<>(subset));

                // Then, add the subset with the first element
                subset.add(0, first);
                output.add(new ArrayList<>(subset));
            }

            return output;
        }
    }
}
```
----- another analysis -----
Errors:

1. The powerset function does not actually return a powerset, but just a set that contains all elements and the empty set. This occurs because it only adds one of the subsets (the one containing all elements in the array) to the output.

2. The ArrayList "to_add" should not include all elements from each subset of the rest_subsets, but should include a subset that contains the first element and the elements of each of the subsets of rest_subsets.

3. The output ArrayList does not include the subsets of the rest_subsets, which must also be part of the powerset.

4. The ArrayList to_add should have a scope inside the for loop since it changes for each subset of rest_subsets.

Corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POWERSET {
    public static ArrayList<ArrayList> powerset(ArrayList arr) {
        if (arr.isEmpty()) {
            ArrayList<ArrayList> empty_set = new ArrayList<>();
            empty_set.add(new ArrayList());
            return empty_set;
        } else {
            Object first = arr.get(0);
            ArrayList rest = new ArrayList(arr.subList(1, arr.size()));
            ArrayList<ArrayList> rest_subsets = powerset(rest);

            ArrayList<ArrayList> output = new ArrayList<>();
            for (ArrayList subset : rest_subsets) {
                output.add(subset); 
                ArrayList to_add = new ArrayList(subset);
                to_add.add(0,first);
                output.add(to_add); 
            }
            return output;
        }
    }
}
```

This corrected version of the code ensures that all subsets of the input set are correctly computed and included in the final powerset.
