The error in the code is within the second for-each loop where it is iterating over `arr` instead of `counts`. 

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BUCKETSORT {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(k,0));
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            counts.set(x,counts.get(x)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> sorted_arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(100);
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer count : counts) {
            sorted_arr.addAll(Collections.nCopies(count, i));
            i++;
        }

        return sorted_arr;
    }
}
```

This for-each loop is supposed to iterate over the `counts` list (that is holding record of occurrences of each integer in original `arr`) rather than the original `arr`. Also, creating ArrayList of size `100` might lead to IndexOutOfBoundsException if `arr` contains more than 100 elements. Better to not specify the size at the time of ArrayList creation or make it match the size of input ArrayList.
----- another analysis -----
The code contains an error in the usage of the for-each loop in the second part of the code. The developer aims to iterate through every "bucket count" to place their values into the `sorted_arr` array, but currently it is incorrectly iterating through the original array.

Corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BUCKETSORT {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(k,0));
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            counts.set(x,counts.get(x)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> sorted_arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer count : counts) {
            sorted_arr.addAll(Collections.nCopies(count, i));
            i++;
        }

        return sorted_arr;
    }
}
```

The changes include:
- Replacing `arr` with `counts` in the second for-each loop.
- Removed the initial capacity (100) from the initialization of `sorted_arr` as ArrayList is dynamically resized in Java; there's no need to specify the size upfront unless you have a clear idea of the number of elements it will contain.

----- another analysis -----

The errors present in the code are:

1. While creating the `sorted_arr`, the size is hard-coded to 100, which is not necessary since we are using an ArrayList which is dynamic in size.
2. In the second loop, the counts array should be iterated, not the original array.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BUCKETSORT {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(k,0));
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            counts.set(x,counts.get(x)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> sorted_arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer count : counts) {
            sorted_arr.addAll(Collections.nCopies(count, i));
            i++;
        }

        return sorted_arr;
    }
}
```

Makes sure that `arr` contains only positive numbers and no number exceeds `k-1` because we are using indices for counting. Also note that this sorting is not stable. It just counts the occurrence of each number, and disregard the order of their original appearance.

There are few issues with the code:

1. In the second for loop, arr is used instead of counts.
2. ArrayList sorted_arr is initialized with size 100, but the size should be variable according to the input.  

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BUCKETSORT {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(k,0));
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            counts.set(x,counts.get(x)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> sorted_arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer count : counts) {
            sorted_arr.addAll(Collections.nCopies(count, i));
            i++;
        }

        return sorted_arr;
    }
}
```

This code initializes the sorted_arr with no initial size. The second loop runs over the counts ArrayList rather than the input arr. This ensures that each value is replicated the correct number of times.
----- another analysis -----
The code has logic errors:

1. The size of the 'sorted_arr' arraylist is hard-coded to 100, which should not be the case.
2. Inside the second for loop, you are iterating over the original array 'arr', and it should be over the 'counts' array.

Here's the corrected version of code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BUCKETSORT {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(k,0));
        for (Integer x : arr) {
            counts.set(x,counts.get(x)+1);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> sorted_arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int i = 0;
        for (Integer count : counts) {
            sorted_arr.addAll(Collections.nCopies(count, i));
            i++;
        }

        return sorted_arr;
    }
}
```
The code initializes an array of size 'k' (max value + 1 in array 'arr') with all zero (0s). Then, for every element 'x' present in array 'arr', it increments the the value at index 'x' in 'counts' array. After that, it goes through each element in 'counts' (not 'arr'), and for each element 'count', it adds 'count' number of 'i' in the 'sorted_arr'.
