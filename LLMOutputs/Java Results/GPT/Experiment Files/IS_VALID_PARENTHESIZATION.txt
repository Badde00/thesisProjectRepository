The given code does in fact contain an error: the method checks parentheses balance but it only checks for opening ones '(' and assumes that any other character is a closing one ')'. If a string with characters other than '(' and ')' is input, the code will give incorrect results. Also, the function does not properly detect closed parentheses. If the number of opening parentheses differs from the number of closing ones, the function will still return true, whereas it should return false in such cases. 

Here's an amended version of the provided code that corrects these problems:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IS_VALID_PARENTHESIZATION {
    public static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < parens.length(); i++) {
            char paren = parens.charAt(i);
            if (paren == '(') {
                depth++;
            } 
            else if (paren == ')') {
                depth--;
                if (depth < 0) { 
                  return false; 
                }
            }
            else {
              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid character " + paren);
            }
        }
        return depth == 0;
    }
}
```

This version checks for closing parentheses properly and also throws an error if there is any character that is not a parenthesis. This version will also return false if there are more opening parentheses than closing ones, which the original version didn't do.
----- another analysis -----
The code is almost correct, but it has one error: it will return true for strings that are missing closing braces but are otherwise correctly formed (for example, "(("). The depth would still be positive at the end of the loop and the return statement would return 'true', although the string is incorrectly parenthesized.

Corrected version of code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IS_VALID_PARENTHESIZATION {
    public static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < parens.length(); i++) {
            Character paren = parens.charAt(i);
            if (paren.equals('(')) {
                depth++;
            } else {
                depth--;
                if (depth < 0) { return false; }
            }
        }
        return depth == 0; //only returns true if all parentheses are closed
    }
}
```

Explanation: An additional check is added in the return statement to ensure that the depth is zero. It means all opening parentheses found have matching closing parentheses.
----- another analysis -----
The code checks if the number of opening parentheses '(' is greater than the number of closing parentheses ')'. This will not fully validate a string for correct parenthesization. A string like "())(" would pass the test but it's not correctly parenthesized. 

Corrected Code:
```
import java.util.*;

public class IS_VALID_PARENTHESIZATION {
    public static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < parens.length(); i++) {
            Character paren = parens.charAt(i);
            if (paren.equals('(')) {
                depth++;
            } else if (paren.equals(')')){
                depth--;
                if (depth < 0) { return false; }
            }
        }
        return depth == 0;
    }
}
```
In the corrected code, I added a condition to check if the character is a closing bracket ')'. I also changed the final return to check if the depth is 0. This is because if there are more opening parentheses than closing, the depth will be greater than 0 and the string is not correctly parenthesized. This way the function ensures that each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one and vice versa.
----- another analysis -----
There is an apparent logical error in the code. This function may return true even if the number of opening "()" brackets and closing "()" brackets are not equal. 

For example, this function returns true for a string "((()". While it does not end with a closing bracket, it is still considered valid by the function because we are not checking if 'depth' equals zero at the end of the list of parentheses.

Additionally, the function does not handle unexpected characters. If the string contains characters other than "()" brackets, the function will not recognize this and will simply decrease the depth, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IS_VALID_PARENTHESIZATION {
    public static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < parens.length(); i++) {
            char paren = parens.charAt(i);
            if (paren == '(') {
                depth++;
            } else if(paren == ')') {
                depth--;
                if (depth < 0) { return false; }
            } else {
                return false; // unexpected character
            }
        }
        return depth == 0; // check if every '(' has a matching ')'
    }
}
```

In this corrected code:

1. The function now returns false for a string containing an unexpected character, ensuring only parentheses are considered.

2. The function checks if 'depth' equals zero at the end of the list of parentheses, meaning the number of opening and closing brackets are equal, ensuring the parentheses are valid.
----- another analysis -----
The code has a logical error. The current implementation doesn't account for the situation when the string has an excess of opening parens. The function will return true if the string "(()" is entered because it only checks if we have extra closing parens.

A corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IS_VALID_PARENTHESIZATION {
    public static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < parens.length(); i++) {
            Character paren = parens.charAt(i);
            if (paren.equals('(')) {
                depth++;
            } else if (paren.equals(')')) {
                depth--;
                if (depth < 0) { return false; }
            }
        }
        return depth == 0;
    }
}
```
In this improved version, we only decrease the depth when we encounter a closing parenthesis and check if it's valid by seeing if the depth is zero at the end of the string iteration. This checks that the numbers of open and close parenthesis are matched.

I also added an else if (paren.equals(')')) to avoid decrementing depth when the character is not a parenthesis.
