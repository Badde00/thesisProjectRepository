The code seems to be implementing breadth-first search algorithm but it has a fundamental mistake. In a queue, nodes should be added to the end, i.e. queue.addLast() should be used instead of queue.addFirst(). If queue.addFirst() is used, the algorithm becomes a depth-first search algorithm.

Another potential issue in the code is there is no exit condition from the while loop if the goalnode is not reachable from the startnode. The code will end up in an infinite loop in such scenario.

Corrected code:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH {

    public static Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();

    public static boolean breadth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startnode);

        nodesvisited.add(startnode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();

            if (node == goalnode) {
                return true;
            } else {
                for (Node successor_node : node.getSuccessors()) {
                    if (!nodesvisited.contains(successor_node)) {
                        queue.addLast(successor_node);
                        nodesvisited.add(successor_node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

There is only one major error in the code:

The queue in the breadth first search algorithm should use `addLast()` to enqueue the successor nodes instead of `addFirst()`. The breadth first search algorithm visits the nodes level by level in a tree/graph which means the successor nodes should be visited after all the other sibling nodes have been visited. When using `addFirst()`, it turns the queue into a stack and switches the algorithm to depth first search.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH {

    public static Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();

    public static boolean breadth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startnode);

        nodesvisited.add(startnode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();

            if (node == goalnode) {
                return true;
            } else {
                for (Node successor_node : node.getSuccessors()) {
                    if (!nodesvisited.contains(successor_node)) {
                        queue.addLast(successor_node);  // Corrected this line
                        nodesvisited.add(successor_node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;  // Added this line to handle case where not every path leads to goalnode
    }
}
```
The above code checks nodes in the order they were added to the queue, which is what we want in breadth-first search. If goal node is unreachable from start node, it will still terminate because the queue will eventually get empty so I added one more return statement at the end.

Errors:

1. Java's syntax doesn't follow the UpperCamelCase model for class names. The name "BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH" is recommended to be named as "BreadthFirstSearch" due to Java's naming conventions.
2. The method "breadth_first_search" violates Java's lowerCamelCase naming convention for methods. It should be "breadthFirstSearch".
3. There is a potential for an empty Deque exception if all nodes don't ultimately lead to the goalnode as there is no check of Deque size before trying to remove the first node.
4. Two imports are unnecessary. 'Dequeue' and 'HashSet' classes are part of the 'java.util' package that is already imported.
5. 'Nodesvisited' field should not be static because making instance fields static can lead to shared state across instances of a class, which can lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs and counterintuitive behavior.

Here, is the suggested corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BreadthFirstSearch {

    public Set<Node> nodesVisited = new HashSet<>();

    public boolean breadthFirstSearch(Node startNode, Node goalNode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startNode);
        nodesVisited.add(startNode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();
            if (node == goalNode) {
                return true;
            }
            for (Node successorNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
                if (!nodesVisited.contains(successorNode)) {
                    queue.addLast(successorNode);
                    nodesVisited.add(successorNode);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
Besides fixing the naming issues and removing the unnecessary imports, I added a check for an empty queue in the while condition and changed 'addFirst' to 'addLast' to preserve the queue (FIFO) nature in breadth-first search.

There are two errors in this Java implementation of the breadth-first search algorithm:

1. The endless loop: Currently, the while loop never breaks if the goal node is not reachable, causing the program to hang. 

2. Incorrect queue operations: In the breadth-first search, nodes are added at the end of the queue but this code is adding nodes at the beginning.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH {

    public static Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();

    public static boolean breadth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startnode);

        nodesvisited.add(startnode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();

            if (node == goalnode) {
                return true;
            } else {
                for (Node successor_node : node.getSuccessors()) {
                    if (!nodesvisited.contains(successor_node)) {
                        queue.addLast(successor_node);
                        nodesvisited.add(successor_node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

In this version of the code, the algorithm will terminate and return false if the queue runs out of nodes (which means the goal node is not reachable). Also, successor nodes are added to the end of the queue, which is the correct procedure in a BFS algorithm.
----- another analysis -----
The logic in implementing Breadth First Search (BFS) seems incorrect. In BFS, nodes should be added at the last (end) of the queue, not at the first. The `queue.removeFirst()` method is used to remove the front of the queue, but `queue.addFirst(successor_node)` will add nodes to the front of queue which contradicts the BFS pattern.

Also, the `while(true)` loop can potentially lead to infinite loop if the `goalnode` is not reachable from the `startnode`. A condition should be used to stop the loop when the queue is empty.

The corrected version of this code should be:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH {

    public static Set<Node> nodesvisited = new HashSet<>();

    public static boolean breadth_first_search(Node startnode, Node goalnode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startnode);

        nodesvisited.add(startnode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();

            if (node == goalnode) {
                return true;
            } else {
                for (Node successor_node : node.getSuccessors()) {
                    if (!nodesvisited.contains(successor_node)) {
                        queue.addLast(successor_node);
                        nodesvisited.add(successor_node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false;   // If goalnode is not reachable from startnode
    }
}
```

This corrected code performs the BFS correctly by adding nodes at the end of the queue. It also prevents infinite loops by breaking out of the `while` loop when the queue is empty. If the `goalnode` is not reachable from `startnode`, it returns false.
