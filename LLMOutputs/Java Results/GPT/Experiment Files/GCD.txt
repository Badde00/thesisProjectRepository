The given code has an error in the recursive call within the gcd function. It should return gcd(b, a % b) instead of gcd(a % b, b).

Here is the corrected version:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```

The function defines the calculation of the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean Algorithm. The condition (b==0) checks if the second number is 0, then the function will return the first number (a) as the gcd. Else, the function will call itself with the two arguments being (b) and (a % b). The algorithm ends when the remainder becomes zero. The divisor at this stage will be the gcd of the two numbers.

There is a logical error in the recursive call inside the gcd() function. According to the Euclidean algorithm for GCD, when the function gcd() is called recursively, then in the next calling, a should be replaced by b and b should be replaced by (a mod b).
Here is the corrected code :

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```
----- another analysis -----
The recursive call to gcd function is incorrect. It should be "return gcd(b, a % b);" rather than "return gcd(a % b, b);" for this program to function correctly as a GCD finder. 

The corrected code is below:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```

This is the implementation of the Euclidean algorithm which uses recursion to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. The base case is when b is 0, and a is the gcd of the two original numbers.
----- another analysis -----
The code contains a logical error. The error is in the line where the recursion takes place. It says return gcd(a % b, b); whereas it should be return gcd(b, a % b); which is the correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

Corrected code:

import java.util.*;

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
----- another analysis -----
The code contains a logical error. In the recursive calling of the gcd function, it should be calling gcd(b, a % b) instead of gcd(a % b, b). This is because during each recursive call, the second argument (b) is being made the first argument (a), and the modulus of the two numbers is being made the second argument.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}
```
