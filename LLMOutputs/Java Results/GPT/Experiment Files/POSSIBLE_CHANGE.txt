Upon reviewing, there is one error in the code:

1. The recursion in this function will turn into an infinite loop if total >= first. The first call in the return statement "possible_change(coins, total-first)" will keep subtracting the same amount "first" from total over and over because the array "coins" is not updated.

Instead, both coins and total need to be updated when making the recursive calls. The code should be updated in this way:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {
    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);
        int ifFirstIncluded = possible_change(coins, total-first);
        int ifFirstExcluded = possible_change(rest, total);
        return ifFirstIncluded + ifFirstExcluded;
    }
}
```

Here, the logic is updated so that the program correctly calculates the number of possible change combinations: In each recursion, there are two scenarios. The first one is the number of combinations if the first coin is included (and that coin can be reused), and the second is the number of combinations if the first coin is not included. Adding them together will get the total number of combinations. If total < 0 or there is no more coin left, this means no combination is possible and should return 0.
----- another analysis -----
The given code is a recursive solution to count all possible combinations of given coin denominations to total up to a given amount. It seems fine logic-wise, but it would be more efficient to use dynamic programming.

Here's a version of the code using dynamic programming, which avoids re-computing sub-problems:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {
    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        int [] comb = new int[total+1];
        comb[0] = 1;
        
        for(int coin : coins){
            for(int i = coin; i <= total; i++){
                comb[i] += comb[i-coin];
            }
        }
        return comb[total];
    }
}
```

This code keeps an array `comb` of size `total+1` such that `comb[i]` will be storing the number of solutions for value `i`. We fill the `comb` array in a bottom-up manner. For all coins smaller than i, we calculate the remaining value (`total - coin value`) and add the number of combinations that sum up to this remaining value. 

This way, we only calculate the number of combinations for each coin value once, and reuse these calculations to find the total number of combinations. This results in an efficient `O(n*m)` algorithm, where `n` is the total value and `m` is the number of coin denominations.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code is almost correct with only one logical error. This is because the 'possible_change' method is supposed to compute the number of possible changes for a given total based on an array of coins. However, the current code will result in an infinite loop when the total is greater than 0 and could cause 'Out of Memory' exception.

This is because 'possible_change(coins, total-first)' is recursively called inside the 'possible_change' method but the condition to stop the recursive calls is missing. Other than that, the rest of the code is logically sound.

A corrected version of the code is as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {
    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);
        return possible_change(coins, total-first) + possible_change(rest, total);
    }
}
```
In this corrected version, the 'possible_change' method checks if the length of the coins array is 0 (meaning there are no coins left to consider) and returns 0, terminating the recursion.
----- another analysis -----
In the provided Java code, there's an infinite recursion error. In the recursive call possible_change(coins, total-first), it does not check whether the coins array is empty. So in a situation where the total can't be made up of the available coin(s), it enters into an infinite loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {

    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);

        return possible_change(new int[] {first}, total-first) + possible_change(rest, total);
    }
}

The corrected version contains an additional condition within the second 'if' statement to check if the length of the coins array is 0. If it is, it means there are no more coins left to be used, so the function should return 0 for no possible ways of change.

Also, the recursive call possible_change(coins, total-first) is corrected to possible_change(new int[] {first}, total-first) to ensure we prepare a new coins array having only the first coin. This ensures only the first coin is considered for this recursive operation.
----- another analysis -----
The code has two main issues:

1. There's no check for the case when there are no coins in the array. As currently designed, the function will trow ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when it tries to access the first element of an empty array.

2. There's potential stack overflow issue because the function will keep on calling itself with the same arguments in certain scenarios (for example, when "total" is more than sum of all items in "coins" array) leading to an infinite recursion.

A corrected version of the code is:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {
    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);
        return possible_change(new int[]{first}, total-first) + possible_change(rest, total);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- Add additional base case checking whether or not there are no coins.
- When calling `possible_change(coins, total-first)`, create a new array with just 'first' element to avoid infinite recursion.
