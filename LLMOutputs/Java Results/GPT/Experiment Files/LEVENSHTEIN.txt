There are no syntax errors in the provided Java code. However, the function doesn't compute the Levenshtein distance correctly. It should calculate the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into the other, but instead, it implements a recursive algorithm which incorrectly handles character comparison and recursion.

Corrected code with the proper algorithm for the calculation of Levenshtein distance:

```java
public class LEVENSHTEIN {
    public static int levenshtein(String source, String target) {
        int sourceLen = source.length();
        int targetLen = target.length();

        int[][] distanceMatrix = new int[sourceLen + 1][targetLen + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= sourceLen; i++) {
            distanceMatrix[i][0] = i;
        }

        for (int j = 0; j <= targetLen; j++) {
            distanceMatrix[0][j] = j;
        }

        for (int j = 1; j <= targetLen; j++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= sourceLen; i++) {
                int substitutionCost = source.charAt(i - 1) == target.charAt(j - 1) ? 0 : 1;
                distanceMatrix[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(
                        distanceMatrix[i - 1][j] + 1,
                        distanceMatrix[i][j - 1] + 1),
                        distanceMatrix[i - 1][j - 1] + substitutionCost);
            }
        }

        return distanceMatrix[sourceLen][targetLen];
    }
}
```
The corrected code initializes a matrix the size of both source and target strings. Then, it determines the cost for substitution of characters, deletion, and insertion by using a dynamic programming approach. This implementation will correctly calculate the Levenshtein distance.

There're no syntax errors in your code.

However, this recursive program calculates the Levenshtein distance, which measures the difference between two strings. The algorithm itself is not erroneous, but it is inefficient.

In its current state, this recursive function will produce many redundant calculations, especially for long strings. This situation is due to the fact that same sub-problems are likely to be calculated multiple times.

Here is a corrected version using Dynamic Programming to solve the redundant calculation problem:

```java
public class LEVENSHTEIN {
    public static int levenshtein(String source, String target) {
        int[][] dp = new int[source.length() + 1][target.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= source.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= target.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = j;
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = i;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] 
                     + costOfSubstitution(source.charAt(i - 1), target.charAt(j - 1)), 
                     dp[i - 1][j] + 1, 
                     dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[source.length()][target.length()];
    }

    public static int costOfSubstitution(char a, char b) {
        return a == b ? 0 : 1;
    }

    public static int min(int... numbers) {
        return Arrays.stream(numbers)
            .min().orElse(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
``` 

The Dynamic Programming course of action constructs an intermediate two-dimensional array and provides an answer in O(n*m) time, where n and m are the lengths of the two strings. This result is significantly quicker than the initial recursive method (which spends exponential time).

This code is trying to calculate Levenshtein distance, but does it in a wrong way (Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other).

Errors:
1. When the first characters of two strings are the same, it shouldn't add 1 to the distance.
2. It shouldn't subtract one character from both strings if the first characters are not the same.

Here is the correct version of the code:
```
import java.util.*;

public class LEVENSHTEIN {
    public static int levenshtein(String source, String target) {
        if (source.isEmpty()) {
            return target.length();
        } else if (target.isEmpty()) {
            return source.length();
        } else if (source.charAt(0) == target.charAt(0)) {
            return levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1));
        } else {
            int replace = levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1));
            int insert = levenshtein(source, target.substring(1));
            int delete = levenshtein(source.substring(1), target);

            return 1 + Math.min(Math.min(replace, insert), delete);
        }
    }
}
```
----- another analysis -----
The code does have a logic error. As per the Levenshtein distance algorithm, it's supposed to check if the first characters of the strings match, if they do, move on to the next character, if they don't, perform insertion, deletion, or substitution operation and move on the next character. But in this code, when the characters match, it increments the distance which should not be the case. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LEVENSHTEIN {
    public static int levenshtein(String source, String target) {
        if (source.isEmpty() || target.isEmpty()) {
            return source.isEmpty() ? target.length() : source.length();
        } else if (source.charAt(0) == target.charAt(0)) {
            return levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1));  // removed 1+
        } else {
            return 1 + Math.min(Math.min(
                    levenshtein(source,              target.substring(1)),
                    levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1))),
                    levenshtein(source.substring(1), target)
        );
        }
    }
}
```

Although above code is correct, it can be extremely slow for larger strings since it computes the same subproblems multiple times, a dynamic programming approach would solve this problem.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code has logical errors in it. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. In other words, it is the measure of the difference between two strings. 

The code provided seems to attempt recursive implementation to find the Levenshtein distance. However, it's incorrect. When two characters at the start of the input strings are the same, it's not necessary to increase the Levenshtein distance. 

Here is the corrected version of the method:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class LEVENSHTEIN {

    public static int levenshtein(String source, String target) {
        if (source.isEmpty()) {
            return target.length();
        } else if (target.isEmpty()){
            return source.length();
        } else if (source.charAt(0) == target.charAt(0)) {
            return levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1));
        } else {
            return 1 + Math.min(Math.min(
                    levenshtein(source,              target.substring(1)),
                    levenshtein(source.substring(1), target.substring(1))),
                    levenshtein(source.substring(1), target)
            );
        }
    }
}
```
Just a note, this version of algorithm tends to be extremely slow and inefficient due to overlapping subproblems in recursion and much repeated computation. It's more common to use a dynamic-programming approach when computing the Levenshtein distance.
