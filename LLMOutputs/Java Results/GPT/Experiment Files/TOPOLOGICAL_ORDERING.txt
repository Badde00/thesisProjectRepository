There are no syntax errors in this code but it has logical errors. The function topological_ordering doesn't implement correctly a typical topological sort algorithm.

Here is a corrected version of the code. This code uses Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    public List<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {
        List<Node> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<Node> noIncomingEdges = new LinkedList<>();
        Map<Node, Integer> incomingEdges = new HashMap<>();

        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            incomingEdges.put(node, node.getPredecessors().size());
            if (node.getPredecessors().isEmpty()) {
                noIncomingEdges.add(node);
            }
        }

        while (!noIncomingEdges.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = noIncomingEdges.poll();
            result.add(node);

            for (Node nextNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
                incomingEdges.put(nextNode, incomingEdges.get(nextNode) - 1);

                if (incomingEdges.get(nextNode) == 0) {
                    noIncomingEdges.add(nextNode);
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

In the above code, every node first gets a count of its incoming edges. Nodes with no incoming edges are added to a queue. Then, while there are nodes without incoming edges available, remove one from the queue, add it to the result, and reduce the count of incoming edges for all its "next" nodes. If this causes a "next" node to have no more incoming edges, it is added to the queue.

The code provided here does not seem to have any syntax error, but it might not be able to produce the correct results for all kinds of directed graphs. The issue lies in the logic of the topological ordering. Here, the code just checks for predecessors of nodes and then, if all successors are already in the list, adds the node to the list. This might not work for more complex graphs with cycles or specific order requirements.

The topological sort can be efficiently achieved by Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm.

Here's a correct implementation for the topological ordering using Depth-First Search (DFS):

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Node{
   private String value;
   private boolean visited;
   private List<Node> neighbours;

   // getters, setters and other methods
}


public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    public void depthFirstSearch(Node node, Deque<Node> stack) {
        node.setVisited(true);
        for (Node child : node.getNeighbours()){
            if (!child.isVisited()) {
                depthFirstSearch(child, stack);
            }
        }
        stack.push(node);
    }

    public List<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {
        Deque<Node> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            if (!node.isVisited()){
                depthFirstSearch(node, stack);
            }
        }
        ArrayList<Node> orderedNodes = new ArrayList<>(stack);
        Collections.reverse(orderedNodes);
        return orderedNodes; 
    }
}
```

The implementation above follows a Depth-First Search approach where each unvisited node is traversed and then added to the stack. After all nodes are visited, they are popped from the stack into a list to get topological order. Then, the list is reversed as the current list would represent a reverse topological order. This code also assumes you have a Node class defined with the necessary methods and attributes.
----- another analysis -----
This code seems to be attempting a Topological sort on a directed graph. However, there are a few problems with this code:

1) Nodes with predecessors are not being processed. Topological ordering requires all nodes of the graph to be considered.
2) The conditional statement for adding the nextNode into 'orderedNodes' is incorrect. A node should be added only when all its predecessors are in 'orderedNodes' list, not its successors.
3) The process of expanding the loop as elements are added to 'orderedNodes' can lead to an infinite loop in some cases.
4) The graph might have cycles, which needs to be detected to avoid indefinite loops.
5) There's no handling for disconnected graphs; such graphs would need separate processing since this solution would miss nodes in the components that don't contain the starting node.

Here is an example of a simple correct topological sort implemented using Depth-First Search:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    public Stack<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
        Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();

        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            if (!visited.contains(node)) {
                topologicalSortUtil(node, visited, stack);
            }
        }

        return stack;
    }

    private void topologicalSortUtil(Node node, Set<Node> visited, Stack<Node> stack) {
        visited.add(node);

        for (Node nextNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
            if (!visited.contains(nextNode)) {
                topologicalSortUtil(nextNode, visited, stack);
            }
        }

        stack.push(node);
    }
}
```
In this corrected implementation, 'topological_ordering' method will return a Stack of nodes in which the nodes are in their topologically sorted order. This code also handle unconnected nodes or different components in the graph.

NOTE: This code assumes that the provided graph is acyclic. If the graph might have cycles, you will need to handle this case separately (for example, by keeping a separate set of 'visiting' nodes, and throwing an error if you visit a node that's already being visited).
----- another analysis -----
This Java program is not obviously incorrect, but it has a wrong implementation for the topological ordering. 

Currently, it's just adding nodes with no predecessors to the 'orderedNodes', then for each of these nodes traverse their successors. If all successors are already in 'orderedNodes' and if the successor node is not in 'orderedNodes', it will be added to the list (the end of it). This is not what the topological order is meant to do.

Here is a corrected version of the code using Depth-First Search algorithm:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    private static Stack<Node> Stack = new Stack<>();

    private static void topologicalSortUtil(Node node, Map<Node, Boolean> visited) {
        visited.put(node, true);
        for (Node n : node.getSuccessors()) {
            if (!visited.get(n)) {
                topologicalSortUtil(n, visited);
            }
        }
        Stack.push(node);
    }

    public static List<Node> topological_ordering(List<Node> directedGraph) {
        Map<Node, Boolean> visited = new HashMap<>();
        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            visited.put(node, false);
        }
        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            if (!visited.get(node)) {
                topologicalSortUtil(node, visited);
            }
        }
        List<Node> orderedNodes = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!Stack.isEmpty()) {
            orderedNodes.add(Stack.pop());
        }
        return orderedNodes;
    }
}
```

This corrected version covers the topological ordering correctly by using Depth-First Search algorithm for all vertices not visited. Then, using Stack data structure to store the vertices in decreasing order of finishing times, which is the topological order.

You should have a complete Directed Acyclic Graph, and a good definition of Node object for the method 'topological_ordering' work properly in both versions.
----- another analysis -----
The code is implementing a simple topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), but it is incorrect. This algorithm does not account for directed edges in the graph and will cause an error if there is a cycle in the graph.

Following is the corrected version of the code that properly implements topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Node {
   // Assuming there are getPredecessors() and getSuccessors() methods to get the predecessors and successors of a node.
}

public class TopologicalOrdering {
    public static List<Node> topologicalOrdering(List<Node> directedGraph) {
        List<Node> orderedNodes = new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        HashMap<Node, Integer> inDegree = new HashMap<>();

        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            inDegree.put(node, node.getPredecessors().size());
            if (node.getPredecessors().size() == 0)
                queue.add(node);
        }

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = queue.poll();
            orderedNodes.add(node);

            for (Node nextNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
                inDegree.put(nextNode, inDegree.get(nextNode) - 1);

                if (inDegree.get(nextNode) == 0)
                    queue.add(nextNode);
            }
        }

        if (orderedNodes.size() != directedGraph.size()) 
            throw new RuntimeException("The graph contains a cycle!");
        
        return orderedNodes;
    }
}
```

In the corrected version of the code, I used Kahn's algorithm which is a standard algorithm for topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The algorithm maintains a queue of the nodes with no incoming edge (in-degree of 0) and processes them one by one, reducing the in-degree of their successors. If at the end all nodes are processed and included in the result, then a topological order was found. Otherwise, the graph contains a cycle and no topological order exists.
