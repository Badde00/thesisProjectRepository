The provided code appears to be valid, assuming the 'Node' class is defined. However, without knowing what the 'Node' class looks like, it's impossible to tell if everything is correct.

Here is implementation of Node class in Java which can work fine with the above solution. If 'Node' class is not similar to the one below, Then it won't work.

public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        next = null;
    }

    public Node getSuccessor(){
        return this.next;
    }

    public void setSuccessor(Node next){
        this.next = next;
    }
}
----- another analysis -----
There are no syntax errors in the code.

However, two potential logical errors could occur depending on how class Node is implemented:

1. If the Node class does not have getSuccessor() or setSuccessor() methods, these calls will fail. 

2. If the Node class's successor field is not named "Successor", the getSuccessor() and setSuccessor() methods will not work as expected.

Although without context it's impossible to say for sure if these are errors, typically, in Java, getters and setters follow the form getFieldName() and setFieldName(). We will assume that the Node was intended to be a simple Linked List node with a next pointer. 

Here's a potential corrected version of the code, assuming a correct implementation of Node class:

```java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }

    public Node getNext() {
        return next;
    }

    public void setNext(Node next) {
        this.next = next;
    }
}

public class ReverseLinkedList {
    public static Node reverseLinkedList(Node node) {
        Node prevNode = null;
        Node nextNode;
        
        while (node != null) {
            nextNode = node.getNext();
            node.setNext(prevNode);
            prevNode = node;
            node = nextNode;
        }
        
        return prevNode;
    }
}
```

This code also includes a small refactor to have CamelCase class name as per Java convention.

The code provided seems fine without any syntax errors. However, as it's impossible to verify without seeing actual `Node` class and methods `getSuccessor()` and `setSuccessor()`, we can assume these methods are correctly implemented within Node class.

Assuming the Node class and methods are properly implemented, the function should correctly reverse a linked list. 

Just some notes to keep in mind:
1) This method only reverses the link direction of nodes. Meaning the data doesn't change but the next pointers change.
2) Node class should have a method setSuccessor() which sets the next pointer to given Node and getSuccessor() that fetches the next Node.
3) If this is part of a larger codebase, consider appropriate null checks and error handling.
----- another analysis -----
The provided code does not contain any errors, assuming the Node class is already implemented with getSuccessor() and setSuccessor(Node) methods.

However, it's impossible for me to confirm the correctness as the Node class and its methods are not provided. In a typical Node class for a LinkedList, these methods should look like this:

```
class Node {
    Node next;
    // Assume that there is a data field as well.
    
    Node getSuccessor() {
        return next;
    }

    void setSuccessor(Node node) {
        next = node;
    }
}
```

If this is the case, then your reverse_linked_list implementation should work.

The code provided is logically correct. However, without context on what the `Node` class looks like or what functionality it provides, it is hard to accurately assess whether there are any errors. 

Assuming the `Node` class has a `getSuccessor()` method to retrieve next node and `setSuccessor()` method to set the next node, there are no discernible syntax or logic errors in the provided code. If these methods don't exist in your `Node` class, you will need to add them. 

The given code would work if you have a `Node` class similar to this:

```java
public class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    // Assuming 'data' is the data carried by this Node and 'next' is pointer to next Node

    Node(int d) {
        data = d;
        next = null;
    }

    // Getter for next Node
    public Node getSuccessor() {
        return this.next;
    }

    // Setter for next Node
    public void setSuccessor(Node nextnode) {
        this.next = nextnode;
    }
}
```

Remember, it's important to analyse the context in which the code is being used.
