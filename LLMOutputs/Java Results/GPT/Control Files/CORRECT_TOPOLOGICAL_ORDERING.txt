The code does not seem to contain any syntax errors. However, there may be a logic error in the topological ordering algorithm that this code implements. 

In topological ordering, the algorithm should ensure that all of the predecessors of a node n have been added to `orderedNodes` before n itself is added. This code simply adds any node to `orderedNodes` which has no predecessors and then in the subsequent loop, it checks if `orderedNodes` contains all predecessors of a 'nextNode' before adding 'nextNode' to 'orderedNodes'. 

If the graph contains cycle or directed graph is not a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), this implementation will lead to incorrect results or even infinite loop. It does not handle the cases when a graph is not a DAG.

Also increasing `listSize` inside the loop where it is a limit may cause incorrect behavior or infinite loops because the included nodes within each step of the algorithm might never be processed for their successors.

A better implementation would use Depth-First Search (DFS) to ensure correct order in topological sort in case of a DAG. And before topological sort, we should check if a graph is DAG or not.
----- another analysis -----
This code appears to contain one main logical error. The `listSize` variable is updated during the iteration, and it's not common to modify the limit of the iteration during its execution because this might lead to unexpected behavior.

In the current code, when a successor of a node gets processed (added to the `orderedNodes` list), you increase `listSize`. This successor's successors might now also be processed in the same run, which is incorrect in a topological ordering. Every node must be processed level by level.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java_programs.Node;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    public static ArrayList<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {
        ArrayList<Node> orderedNodes = new ArrayList<Node>();
        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            if (node.getPredecessors().isEmpty()) {
                orderedNodes.add(node);
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < orderedNodes.size(); i++) { // Use orderedNodes.size() instead of listSize
            Node node = orderedNodes.get(i);
            for (Node nextNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
                if (orderedNodes.containsAll(nextNode.getPredecessors()) && !orderedNodes.contains(nextNode)) {
                    orderedNodes.add(nextNode);
                }
            }
        }
        return orderedNodes;
    }
}
```

Please note: This version still is not a correct topological sort algorithm. Please use DFS (Depth First Search) or in-degree methods to perform topological sort. This version is just a corrected one based on your existing logic.

There are no compile-time errors in the provided code, but there is a logical error in the implementation of the topological ordering algorithm. 

The current topological ordering process will not correctly order nodes in the presence of loops or if there are nodes that are not reachable from a node with no predecessors. 

Here is the corrected code with depth-first search:

```
import java.util.*;

public class Node {
    private List<Node> successors = new ArrayList<>();

    // getters and setters
    public List<Node> getSuccessors() {
        return successors;
    }

    public void addSuccessor(Node node) {
        this.successors.add(node);
    }
}

public class TopologicalOrdering {
    
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
    LinkedList<Node> stack = new LinkedList<>();

    private void topologicalOrderUtil(Node node) {
        visited.add(node);
        for(Node current : node.getSuccessors()) {
            if(!visited.contains(current))
                topologicalOrderUtil(current);
        }
        stack.push(node);
    }
    public List<Node> topologicalOrder(List<Node> graph) {
        for(Node node : graph) {
            if(!visited.contains(node)) {
                topologicalOrderUtil(node);
            }
        }
        ArrayList<Node> resultList = new ArrayList<>(stack);
        Collections.reverse(resultList);
        return resultList;
    }
}
```
This code assumes `Node` class consists of a list for its successors. It first marks the current node as visited, then it recursively visits its successors if they are not visited yet. After all the successors have been visited, the node is pushed into the stack. When the algorithm finishes, it reverses the stack and returns the ArrayList that contains the topological order of the graph.
----- another analysis -----
The code seems logical and there are no compile-time errors detectable. However, I noticed that this code does not correctly implement a topological sort. A topological ordering is possible only for directed acyclic graphs (acyclic meaning the graph has no cyclic references). The current implementation may cause an infinite loop if there is a cyclic reference in the graph since the condition to add a node to the orderedNodes list does not take this into account. 

Consider implementing Kahn's algorithm or Depth-First search for topological sorting which correctly handles cycles. Below is this approach using Kahn's Algorithm:

```java
import java.util.*;

import java_programs.Node;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING {
    public static ArrayList<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {
        ArrayList<Node> orderedList = new ArrayList<Node>();
        Queue<Node> zeroIncomingEdgesQueue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        
        Map<Node, Integer> incomingEdgesCountMap = new HashMap<Node, Integer>();
        for(Node node : directedGraph){
            int count = node.getPredecessors().size();
            incomingEdgesCountMap.put(node, count);
            if(count == 0){
                 zeroIncomingEdgesQueue.add(node);
            }
        }
        
        while (!zeroIncomingEdgesQueue.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = zeroIncomingEdgesQueue.poll();
            orderedList.add(node);
            for (Node successors : node.getSuccessors()) {
                int count = incomingEdgesCountMap.get(successors) - 1;
                incomingEdgesCountMap.put(successors, count);
                if (count == 0) {
                    zeroIncomingEdgesQueue.add(successors);
                }
            }
        }
        
        if(orderedList.size() != directedGraph.size()){
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cyclic graph detected. Topological sort not possible.");
        }
        
        return orderedList;
    }
}
```
The Kahn's Algorithm creates a queue of nodes with no incoming edges (predecessors) or the starting nodes and then for each node, decrease the counter for all its successors. When their counter becomes zero, you know all their predecessors have been ordered, so they can be queued. It also detects a cycle when the ordered list size is not the same as the original graph size.
----- another analysis -----
The code snippet seems functional except one error that it does not contain error checking and is not reliable in cases when the provided graph contains cycles.

Therefore, we should add some kind of cycle detection to ensure that the task is completed successfully. 

Here is an example of the typically implemented topological ordering using DFS:

```java

import java.util.*;

import java_programs.Node;

public class TOPOLOGICAL_ORDERING { 

    private enum NodeState {
        VISITED,
        VISITING,
        UNVISITED
    }

    public static ArrayList<Node> topological_ordering (List<Node> directedGraph) {

        ArrayList<Node> orderedNodes = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Node, NodeState> nodeStates = new HashMap<>();

        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            nodeStates.put(node, NodeState.UNVISITED);
        }

        for (Node node : directedGraph) {
            if (nodeStates.get(node) == NodeState.UNVISITED) {
                if (!DFS(node, nodeStates, orderedNodes)) {
                    return null; // cycle detected
                }
            }
        }

        Collections.reverse(orderedNodes); // Reverse the list
        return orderedNodes;
    }

    private static boolean DFS(Node node, HashMap<Node, NodeState> nodeStates, ArrayList<Node> orderedNodes) {
        nodeStates.put(node, NodeState.VISITING);

        for (Node neighbor : node.getSuccessors()) {
            NodeState state = nodeStates.get(neighbor);
            if (state == NodeState.VISITING) {
                return false; // cycle detected
            } else if (state == NodeState.UNVISITED) {
                if (!DFS(neighbor, nodeStates, orderedNodes)) {
                    return false; // cycle detected
                }
            }
        }

        nodeStates.put(node, NodeState.VISITED);
        orderedNodes.add(node);
        return true;
    }
}
```
The way to detect a cycle here is to not only record whether a node has been visited or not, but to track if a node is currently being visited. If during the DFS, we visit a node that is currently being visited, it means that there is cycle in the graph.
