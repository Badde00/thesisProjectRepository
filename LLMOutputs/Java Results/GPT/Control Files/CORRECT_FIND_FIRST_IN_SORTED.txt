The given Java code has no syntax errors. It correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of an integer 'x' in a sorted array 'arr'. In the while-loop, the condition checks for the first occurrence of the integer in the ascending order sorted array. 

This version of the binary search splits the array into two halves in each iteration and discards the half where the integer 'x' can't be present, hence reducing time complexity to O(log n) compared to a linear search approach which would be O(n). On the other hand, the inner condition checks for the first occurrence of the integer avoiding repeats.

Therefore, the code should work without issues given the input array is sorted in ascending order.

The code seems fine as it uses Binary Search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted integer array. There are no errors present. This function will return the first occurrence index of the given integer 'x'. If 'x' is not in the array, it will return -1. Note that the array must be sorted for this code to work correctly.

The code appears to be correct with no errors as it does what's intended. This Java function is designed to find first occurrence of a number (int x) in a sorted array (int[] arr) using a binary search approach. It returns the index of its first occurrence, and if the number doesn't exist in the array, it returns -1. 

Just a minor optimization which could be useful, although the program works as it is without it:

In the second `if` inside the `while` loop, we are needlessly checking `x <= arr[mid]` at every iteration of the loop. If we already know that `x == arr[mid]`, we don't need to perform the `x <= arr[mid]` check again for the same `mid`. We only need to check if `x < arr[mid]`:

```java
if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
    return mid;
} else if (x < arr[mid]) {
    hi = mid;
} else {
    lo = mid + 1;
}
```

For the logic of the function itself, it first sets the lower and upper bounds as `lo` and `hi` respectively. It then enters a while loop where it calculates the midpoint. If the value at `arr[mid]` is equal to `x` and it's the first occurrence, it returns the index mid. If `x` is less than or equal to `arr[mid]`, it moves the upper bound to mid. If `x` is more than `arr[mid]`, it moves the lower bound to `mid + 1`. The loop continues till it finds the first occurrence, if it doesn't find any, it returns -1. This method uses the principle of Binary Search.

The code seems to be logically correct as it is intended to find the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array. However, there is one logical error which might cause the function to loop indefinitely.

Problem: In the while loop, if `x <= arr[mid]`, it assigns `hi` to `mid`. In a situation where `lo` and `hi` are consecutive, `(lo+hi)/2` would give `lo` (since integer division truncates decimals), and mid will remain same in next loop, leading to an infinite loop.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr.length;

        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;   // to avoid overflow as well

            if (x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1])) {
                return mid;
            }
```
else if (x < arr[mid]) {  // if element is less than mid,more to the left
                hi = mid;   // so set hi = mid 
            } 
            else {
                lo = mid + 1;   
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

}
```

Explanation: Now for condition `x < arr[mid]`, `hi` is set to `mid`, so that it doesn't stuck in an infinite loop when `lo` and `hi` are consecutive. The `mid` value is calculated with the expression `lo + (hi - lo) / 2` to avoid potential overflow with large `lo` and `hi` values.

The code is correct and should work as intended. The code is a Java function that finds the first occurrence of a number `x` in a sorted array `arr`. If the number does not exist in the array, it returns `-1`.

However, it's worth noting that in the condition `(x == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || x != arr[mid-1]))`, checking `mid == 0` before `x != arr[mid-1]` could potentially run into an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if `mid` is indeed `0`. While the current order actually prevents that from happening (short-circuit order of operations in Java means it won't attempt `x != arr[mid-1]` if `mid` is `0`), it would be more readable and clear to not rely on short-circuit behavior. Here's what that version would like:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FIND_FIRST_IN_SORTED {

    public static int find_first_in_sorted(int[] arr, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == x && (mid == 0 || arr[mid - 1] != x)) {
                return mid;
            }
            else if (x <= arr[mid]) {
                high = mid;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

}
```
So, although the code is technically correct, this small readability improvement would make it less likely for similar code to cause issues in the future.
