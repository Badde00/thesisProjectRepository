 1 . The ` quick sort ` method is not static , but it is being called as if it were a static method . 
 2 . The ` p ivot ` variable is not being initialized . 
 3 . The ` less er ` and ` gre ater ` variables are not being initialized . 
 4 . The ` middle ` variable is not being initialized . 
 5 . The ` less er ` and ` gre ater ` variables are being assigned to the result of the ` quick sort ` method , but the ` quick sort ` method is not returning anything . 
 6 . The ` less er ` and ` gre ater ` variables are being added to the ` middle ` variable , but the ` middle ` variable is not being initialized .

 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The method ` quick sort ` is defined as a static method , but it is called as an instance method . This is corrected by making the method static .

 3 . The method ` quick sort ` returns an ` ArrayList < Integer > `, but it is not initialized . This is corrected by initial izing the list with the ` new ArrayList < Integer > ()` constructor . 
 4 . The method ` quick sort ` uses the ` sub List ` method to get a sub list of the input array , but it does not check if the sub list is empty . This is corrected by checking if the sub list is empty before using it . 
 5 . The method ` quick sort ` uses the ` add ` method to add elements to the ` less er ` and ` gre ater ` lists , but it does not check if the element is already in the list . This is corrected by checking if the element is already in the list before adding it . 
 6 . The method ` quick sort ` uses the ` add All ` method to add the ` gre ater ` list to the ` middle ` list , but it does not check if the ` gre ater ` list is empty . This is corrected by checking if the ` gre ater ` list is empty before adding it to the ` middle ` list .
