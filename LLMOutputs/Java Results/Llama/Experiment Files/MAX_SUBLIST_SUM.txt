        int max End ing Here =  0 ;

        } 
 
        return max So F ar ; 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 * The class name should start with an upper case letter , so it should be ` Max Sub list Sum ` instead of ` MAX _ SUB LIST _ SUM `. 
 * The method name should also start with an upper case letter , so it should be ` max Sub list Sum ` instead of ` max _ sub list _ sum `. 
 * The variable names should be more descript ive , so ` max End ing Here ` and ` max So F ar ` should be renamed to ` max Sum End ing Here ` and ` max Sum So F ar `, respectively . 
 * The ` Math . max ` method should be used to find the maximum value between ` max Sum End ing Here ` and ` max Sum So F ar `, instead of using the t ern ary operator . 
 * The ` for ` loop should be using the ` :` operator instead of the ` =` operator , to avoid over writing the value of ` x `. 
 * The ` return ` statement should be ind ented to align with the ` for ` loop . 
 
 Over all , the corrected code is more readable and easier to understand , and it follows the Java naming convent ions .
