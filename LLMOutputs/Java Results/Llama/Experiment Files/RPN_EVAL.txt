 1 . The ` rp n _ eval ` method should return a ` Double `, but it is currently returning a ` Stack `. 
 2 . The ` op ` map should be declared as a ` Map < String , Binary Operator < Double >> `, but it is currently declared as a ` Map < String , Binary Operator > `. 
 3 . The ` stack ` variable should be declared as a ` Stack < Double > `, but it is currently declared as a ` Stack `. 
 4 . The ` for ` loop should use the ` Iterator ` interface to iterate over the ` to kens ` list , but it is currently using the ` Object ` class . 
 5 . The ` if ` statement should check if the ` token ` is an instance of ` Double `, but it is currently checking if it is an instance of ` String `. 
 6 . The ` token ` variable should be declared as a ` String `, but it is currently declared as an ` Object `. 
 7 . The ` a `, ` b `, and ` c ` variables should be declared as ` Double ` variables , but they are currently declared as ` Object ` variables . 
 8 . The ` bin _ op ` variable should be declared as a ` Binary Operator < Double >` variable , but it is currently declared as a ` Binary Operator ` variable .
