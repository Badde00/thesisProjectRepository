 2 . The method signature is incorrect . The method should return a ` List < Node >` instead of an ` ArrayList < Node > `. 
 3 . The method should take a ` List < Node >` as an argument instead of a ` List < Node > `. 
 4 . The method should use a ` Stack ` data structure instead of an ` ArrayList ` to maintain the topological ordering .

 Note that the corrected code uses ` List ` instead of ` ArrayList ` to store the ordered nodes , and it uses ` Set ` instead of ` ArrayList ` to store the success ors and prede cess ors of each node . This is because ` List ` is a more general interface that can be used with any type of collection , while ` ArrayList ` is a specific implementation of ` List ` that is optimized for random access . Similarly , ` Set ` is a more general interface that can be used with any type of collection , while ` ArrayList ` is a specific implementation of ` Set ` that is optimized for fast lookup and insert ion .
