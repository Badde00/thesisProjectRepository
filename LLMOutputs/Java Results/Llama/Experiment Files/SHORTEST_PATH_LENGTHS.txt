 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The class name ` SH OR TEST _ PATH _ LENGTH S ` should be in upper case , as per Java naming convent ions . 
 2 . The ` import java . lang . Math .* ` statement is not needed , as the ` Math ` class is already imported by the ` import java . util .* ` statement . 
 3 . The ` INF ` constant should be defined as ` Integer . MAX _ VALUE `, as ` 9 9 9 9 9 ` is not a valid value for an integer . 
 4 . The ` sum Length s ` method should be defined as a static method , as it does not use any instance variables . 
 5 . The ` length _ by _ path ` map should be initialized with the ` length _ by _ edge ` map , as the ` length _ by _ path ` map is a copy of the ` length _ by _ edge ` map with some modifications . 
 6 . The ` for ` loop in the ` short est _ path _ length s ` method should be replaced with a ` foreach ` loop , as it is more conc ise and easier to read . 
 7 . The ` length _ by _ path ` map should be returned at the end of the method , as it is the only value that is being returned . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ```

 6 . The ` length _ by _ edge ` map is not used , it should be passed as a parameter to the method . 
 7 . The ` for ` loop in the method is not correct , it should be ` for ( int i =  0 ; i < num Nodes ; i ++) { for ( int j =  0 ; j < num Nodes ; j ++) { if ( i == j ) { length _ by _ path . put ( Array s . as List ( i , j ),  0 ); } else { int update _ length = Math . min ( length _ by _ path . get ( Array s . as List ( i , j )), sum Length s ( length _ by _ path . get ( Array s . as List ( i , k )), length _ by _ path . get ( Array s . as List ( j , k )) )); length _ by _ path . put ( Array s . as List ( i , j ), update _ length ); } } } `. 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util .*; 
 import java . lang . Math .*; 
 
 public class Short est Path Length s { 
    final static int IN F = Integer . MAX _ VALUE ; 
 
    public static Map < List < Integer >, Integer > short est Path Length s ( int num Nodes , Map < List < Integer >, Integer > length _ by _ edge ) {

 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The class name ` SH OR TEST _ PATH _ LENGTH S ` should be in upper case , as per Java naming convent ions . 
 2 . The import statement for ` java . lang . Math ` is not necessary , as the ` Math ` class is already imported by the ` java . util ` import statement . 
 3 . The method ` short est _ path _ length s ` should be renamed to ` short est Path Length s ` to follow Java naming convent ions . 
 4 . The variable ` length _ by _ edge ` is not used in the method , and it should be removed . 
 5 . The variable ` INF ` is not defined , and it should be replaced with ` Integer . MAX _ VALUE `. 
 6 . The method ` sum Length s ` is not used , and it should be removed . 
 7 . The method ` short est Path Length s ` has a bug in the inner loop , where the ` length _ by _ path ` map is being updated with the wrong values . The correct update should be ` length _ by _ path . put ( Array s . as List ( i , j ), Math . min ( length _ by _ path . get ( Array s . as List ( i , k )), length _ by _ path . get ( Array s . as List ( j , k )) )); `.
