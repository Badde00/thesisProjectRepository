 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The class name should start with a capital letter , so it should be ` Long est Common Sub sequence ` instead of ` L ON GE ST _ CO MM ON _ SUB SE QU EN CE `. 
 2 . The method name should start with a capital letter , so it should be ` long est Common Sub sequence ` instead of ` long est _ common _ sub sequence `. 
 3 . The method should return a ` String `, not a ` char `. 
 4 . The method should have a ` public ` access mod ifier . 
 5 . The method should have a ` static ` access mod ifier . 
 6 . The method should have a ` void ` return type , not ` String `. 
 7 . The method should have two parameters , ` a ` and ` b `, of type ` String `. 
 8 . The method should have a ` return ` statement at the end . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util .*;

        if ( a . isEmpty () || b . isEmpty ()) {
