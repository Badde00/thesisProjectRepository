 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The ` update ` method is not properly defined . It should return a new ` Map < Node , Set < Node >> ` instance , but it returns the original ` group By Node ` map . 
 2 . The ` min imum _ sp anning _ tree ` method is not properly defined . It should return a ` Set < Weight ed Edge >` instance , but it returns a ` Map < Node , Set < Node >> ` instance . 
 3 . The ` group By Node ` map is not properly initialized . It should be initialized with an empty ` HashMap < Node , Set < Node >> ` instance , but it is initialized with an empty ` Hash Set < Node >` instance . 
 4 . The ` for ` loop in the ` min imum _ sp anning _ tree ` method is not properly defined . It should iterate over the ` weight ed Ed ges ` list , but it iter ates over the ` group By Node ` map . 
 5 . The ` update ` method is not properly called . It should be called with the ` ver tex _ u ` and ` ver tex _ v ` parameters , but it is called with the ` group By Node ` map and the ` ver tex _ u ` and ` ver tex _ v ` parameters . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util .*; 
 
 public class M IN IM UM _ SP AN N ING _ T REE { 
    public static Set < Weight ed Edge > minimum _ sp anning _ tree ( List < Weight ed Edge > weight ed Ed ges ) { 
        Map < Node , Set < Node >> group By Node = new HashMap <>(); 
        Set < Weight ed Edge > min Sp anning Tree = new Hash Set <>(); 
 
        Col lections . sort ( weight ed Ed ges ); 
 
        for ( Weight ed Edge edge : weight ed Ed ges ) { 
            Node vertex _ u = edge . node 1 ; 
            Node vertex _ v = edge . node 2 ; 
            if (! group By Node . contains Key ( ver tex _ u )) { 
                group By Node . put ( ver tex _ u , new Hash Set < >( Array s . as List ( ver tex _ u ))); 
            } 
            if (! group By Node . contains Key ( ver tex _ v )) { 
                group By Node . put ( ver tex _ v , new Hash Set < >( Array s . as List ( ver tex _ v ))); 
            } 
 
            if ( group By Node . get ( ver tex _ u ) != group By Node . get ( ver tex _ v )) { 
                min Sp anning Tree . add ( edge ); 
                group By Node = update ( group By Node , vertex _ u , vertex _ v ); 
                for ( Node node : group By Node . get ( ver tex _ v )) { 
                    group By Node = update ( group By Node , node , vertex _ u ); 
                } 
            } 
        } 
        return min Sp anning Tree ; 
    } 
 
    public static Map < Node , Set < Node >> update ( Map < Node , Set < Node >> group By Node , Node vertex _ u , Node vertex _ v ) { 
        Set < Node > vertex _ u _ span = group By Node . get ( ver tex _ u ); 
        vertex _ u _ span . add All ( group By Node . get ( ver tex _ v )); 
 
        return new HashMap < >( group By Node ); 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 Note that the corrected code uses a ` HashMap < Node , Set < Node >> ` instance to store the groups of nodes , and it uses the ` update ` method to update the groups of nodes when an edge is added to the minimum sp anning tree .
