 Ex plan ation : 
 
 * The corrected version uses the ` arr . length -  1 ` instead of ` arr . length ` as the end index in the ` bin search ` method . This is because the ` bin search ` method is called with the ` arr . length ` as the end index , which would cause an index out of bounds error . 
 * The corrected version also uses the ` mid -  1 ` instead of ` mid ` as the end index in the ` bin search ` method . This is because the ` bin search ` method is called with the ` mid ` as the end index , which would cause an index out of bounds error . 
 * The corrected version also uses the ` mid +  1 ` instead of ` mid ` as the start index in the ` bin search ` method . This is because the ` bin search ` method is called with the ` mid ` as the start index , which would cause an index out of bounds error .

 * The corrected code uses the ` int ` data type for the ` start `, ` end `, and ` mid ` variables , which is more appropriate for the values that are being assigned to them .

 ``` 
 The corrected version of the code has the following changes : 
 
 * The ` bin search ` method now takes the ` arr . length -  1 ` as the end index , instead of ` arr . length `, to avoid an out - of - bounds error when the element is not found . 
 * The ` find _ in _ sorted ` method now returns the index of the element in the array , instead of the element itself . This is more consistent with the behavior of the ` bin search ` method .

 Ex plan ation : 
 
 * The corrected code uses the ` int ` keyword to specify the data type of the variables ` start `, ` end `, and ` mid `. This is a good practice to avoid confusion with other data types . 
 * The corrected code also uses the ` arr . length ` syntax to get the length of the array , which is more conc ise and easier to read than using the ` length ` method . 
 * The corrected code also uses the ` return ` statement to return the result of the binary search , which is more conc ise and easier to read than using the ` System . out . println ` method .
