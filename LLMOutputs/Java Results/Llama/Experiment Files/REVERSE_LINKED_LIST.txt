        } 
        return prev node ; 
    } 
 } [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The method name is not following the Java naming convent ions . The method name should start with a lower case letter and should not contain any unders c ores . 
 2 . The method is not returning the correct value . The method should return the head node of the revers ed linked list , but it is returning the tail node instead . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util .*; 
 
 public class Re verse Link ed List { 
    public static Node reverse Link ed List ( Node node ) { 
        Node prev node = null ; 
        Node next node ; 
        while ( node != null ) { 
            next node = node . get Success or (); 
            node . set Success or ( prev node ); 
            prev node = node ; 
            node = next node ; 
        } 
        return prev node ; 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 1 . The method name is corrected to follow the Java naming convent ions . 
 2 . The method is corrected to return the head node of the revers ed linked list , instead of the tail node . This is done by assigning the ` prev node ` variable to the ` node ` variable before assigning ` node ` to ` next node `. 
 3 . The ` prev node ` variable is initialized to ` null ` before the loop , to ensure that it is correctly set to the head node of the revers ed linked list .

 1 . The method ` reverse _ link ed _ list ` is defined as a static method , but it is called as an instance method . To fix this , change the definition of the method to ` public static Node reverse _ link ed _ list ( Node node )`. 
 2 . The method ` reverse _ link ed _ list ` returns ` prev node `, but ` prev node ` is not defined . To fix this , define ` prev node ` as a new ` Node ` object before the ` while ` loop .
