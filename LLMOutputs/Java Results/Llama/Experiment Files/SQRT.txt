        } 
        return appro x ; 
    } 
 } [ / INST ]  There are two errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The method name is ` sqrt `, which is a reserved keyword in Java . The method should be renamed to something else , such as ` my S q rt `. 
 2 . The ` epsilon ` parameter is not being used in the method . The method should be modified to use the ` epsilon ` parameter to determine the stopping criter ion for the iteration . 
 
 Here is the corrected code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util .*; 
 
 public class S Q RT { 
    public static double my S q rt ( double x , double e psilon ) { 
        double appro x = x /  2 d ; 
        while ( Math . abs ( x - approx ) > e psilon ) { 
            appro x =  0 . 5 d * ( approx + x / appro x ); 
        } 
        return appro x ; 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 The corrected code uses the ` epsilon ` parameter to determine the stopping criter ion for the iteration . The method will continue to iterate until the difference between the current approximation and the actual value is less than the ` epsilon ` value .
