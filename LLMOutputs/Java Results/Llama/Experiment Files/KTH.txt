 5 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `. 
 6 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `. 
 7 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `. 
 8 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `. 
 9 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `. 
 1 0 . The ` k th ` method is defined as returning a ` String `, but it actually returns a ` Integer `. This is corrected by changing the return type to ` Integer `.
