 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The class name should start with a capital letter , so it should be ` K He aps ort ` instead of ` K HE AP S ORT `. 
 2 . The method name should start with a capital letter , so it should be ` k He aps ort ` instead of ` k he aps ort `. 
 3 . The ` ArrayList ` class is not imported , so the code should include ` import java . util . ArrayList ;` at the top . 
 4 . The ` P riority Queue ` class is not imported , so the code should include ` import java . util . P riority Queue ;` at the top . 
 5 . The ` sub List ` method is not defined for ` ArrayList `, so the code should use ` arr . sub List ( 0 , k )` instead of ` arr . sub List ( 0 , k )`. 
 6 . The ` he ap . add ` method is not defined for ` ArrayList `, so the code should use ` he ap . add ( x )` instead of ` he ap . add ( v )`. 
 7 . The ` he ap . p oll ` method is not defined for ` ArrayList `, so the code should use ` he ap . p oll ()` instead of ` he ap . p oll ( po pped )`. 
 8 . The ` output . add ` method is not defined for ` ArrayList `, so the code should use ` output . add ( po pped )` instead of ` output . add ( po pped )`.

 1 . The ` k he aps ort ` method is defined as a static method , but it is called as an instance method . 
 2 . The ` k ` parameter is not used in the method . 
 3 . The ` he ap ` variable is not initialized . 
 4 . The ` output ` variable is not initialized . 
 5 . The ` sub List ` method is used to get the first ` k ` elements of the ` arr ` list , but it is not clear what the purpose of this is . 
 6 . The ` p oll ` method is used to remove the elements from the ` he ap ` variable , but it is not clear what the purpose of this is . 
 7 . The ` while ` loop is not necessary , as the ` he ap ` variable is already empty after the ` p oll ` method is called .

 ```

 } 
 ``` 
 This code uses a ` P riority Queue ` to sort the elements of the ` arr ` list , and then returns the sorted list . The ` k ` parameter is not used in the method , so it can be removed . The ` sub List ` method is not needed , as the ` he ap ` variable is already initialized with the elements of the ` arr ` list . The ` p oll ` method is used to remove the elements from the ` he ap ` variable , and the ` while ` loop is not necessary , as the ` he ap ` variable is already empty after the ` p oll ` method is called .
