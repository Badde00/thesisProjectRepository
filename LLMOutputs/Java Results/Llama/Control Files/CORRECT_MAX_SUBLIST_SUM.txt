 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : 
 
 * The class name should start with an upper case letter , so I changed it to ` Max Sub list Sum `. 
 * The method name should also start with an upper case letter , so I changed it to ` max Sub list Sum `. 
 * The variable names should be more descript ive , so I changed ` max _ ending _ here ` to ` max End ing Here ` and ` max _ so _ far ` to ` max So F ar `. 
 * The ` Math . max ` method is used to ensure that the sum is not negative , so I added a ` 0 ` as the first argument to ` Math . max `. 
 * The ` Math . max ` method is used to find the maximum value between ` max End ing Here ` and ` max So F ar `, so I changed the second argument to ` max End ing Here ` to ` max End ing Here `. 
 
 Over all , the corrected code should produce the same output as the original code , but with more descript ive variable names and improved read ability .
