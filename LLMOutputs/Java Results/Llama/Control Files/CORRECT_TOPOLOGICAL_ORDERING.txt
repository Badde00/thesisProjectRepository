 } [ / INST ]  There are several errors in the code : 
 
 1 . The import statement for ` java . util .* ` is not needed , as the code does not use any classes from that package . 
 2 . The import statement for ` java _ program s . Node ` is not needed , as the code does not use any classes from that package . 
 3 . The method ` top ological _ order ing ` is not defined as a static method , but it is being called as if it were a static method . 
 4 . The method ` top ological _ order ing ` is not returning anything , but it is declared to return an ` ArrayList < Node > `. 
 5 . The method ` top ological _ order ing ` is using a variable ` list Size ` that is not defined . 
 6 . The method ` top ological _ order ing ` is using a variable ` ordered Nodes ` that is not defined . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 import java . util . ArrayList ; 
 
 public class Top ological Order ing { 
    public static ArrayList < Node > topological Order ing ( List < Node > directed Graph ) { 
        ArrayList < Node > ordered Nodes = new ArrayList < Node >(); 
        for ( Node node : directed Graph ) { 
            if ( node . get Pre de cess ors (). isEmpty ()) { 
                ordered Nodes . add ( node ); 
            } 
        } 
 
        int list Size = ordered Nodes . size (); 
        for ( int i =  0 ; i < list Size ; i ++) { 
            Node node = ordered Nodes . get ( i ); 
            for ( Node next Node : node . get Success ors ()) { 
                if ( ordered Nodes . contains All ( next Node . get Pre de cess ors ()) && ! ordered Nodes . contains ( next Node )) { 
                    ordered Nodes . add ( next Node ); 
                    list Size ++;

            } 
        } 
        return ordered Nodes ; 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 Note that the corrected code uses the ` ArrayList ` class from the ` java . util ` package , and it defines the ` top ological Order ing ` method as a static method . It also uses the ` list Size ` variable to keep track of the size of the ` ordered Nodes ` list , and it uses the ` ordered Nodes ` variable to store the ordered nodes .
