 } [ / INST ]  There is an error in the code . The method ` bit count ` is defined as taking an ` int ` parameter , but it is called with a ` long ` parameter . This will cause a compile - time error . 
 
 Here is a corrected version of the code : 
 ``` 
 public class B IT COUNT { 
    public static int bit count ( long n ) { 
        int count =  0 ;

 This corrected version of the code will compile and run without any errors .

 1 . The method ` bit count ` is not static , but it is being called as a static method . 
 
 Cor rect ed version : 
 ``` 
 public class B IT COUNT { 
    public static int bit count ( int n ) { 
        int count =  0 ; 
        while ( n !=  0 ) { 
            n = ( n & ( n -  1 )); 
            count ++; 
        } 
        return count ; 
    } 
 } 
 ``` 
 Ex plan ation : The method ` bit count ` is not static , but it is being called as a static method . This is not allowed in Java . To fix this , we need to make the method static by adding the ` static ` keyword before the method name .
